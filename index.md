# **Summary**
{: .fs-7 }

This website has been created to summarize our final project for DS105M. Our goal was to create a web scraping plug-in program to seamlessly extract Amazon customer reviews. To demonstrate our program, we extracted data on a computer mouse – the Logitech MX Master 3 and performed data analysis on its customer reviews. 

# **Context**
{: .fs-7 }

In the 21st century business-to-consumer industry, no company has had as strong of an influence on reshaping the competitive landscape as Amazon, vastly expediting the transition from brick-and-mortar to ecommerce dependency. With an average of 200 million unique visitors per month and over 6 million worldwide sellers, Amazon’s sheer size allows it to maintain an ever-growing grip over the ecommerce industry. 

One of the key factors that has contributed to Amazon's growth over time is the center-stage role that customer reviews play in the Amazon shopping experience. Customer reviews are a huge value add for both buyers and sellers on Amazon as they function as an accurate and digestible information channel for customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is a two-way street: buyers want products they purchase to fulfill all their needs, while sellers want to increase customer retention and future customer acquisition. New buyers can refer to the reviews of customers with similar desires to themselves, identifying whether the product succeeds in achieving in their areas of need. At the same time, sellers can analyze customer reviews to derive conclusions as to where their product succeeds in satisfying customers and where they can improve in future iterations. 

Typically, scrolling through the customer reviews section of an Amazon-listed product is enough information for most users to make a conclusion about the product. However, there is a vast variety of extraordinary cases that would require extraction of a subset or all reviews available on an Amazon page. The most obvious use case of review extraction is simple record-keeping, say if a seller wants to keep a copy of reviews published on their product at a given point in time. In more advanced use cases, review data can be analyzed further through descriptive analytics like data visualizations, or NLP methods such as sentiment analysis, opinion modeling, topic modeling, and more. Such analysis should help sellers understand what customers think about their products in a more efficient and digestible manner. 

# **Motivation**

With this large variety of use cases comes an unaddressed issue: there is no easy or efficient method to extract customer reviews. Our primary goal was to create a web-scraping plug in program that can seamlessly extract customer reviews from any Amazon page. Such a program can then be used by businesses, researchers, or any other third party interested in scraping Amazon reviews.   

Additionally, we wanted to provide our own use case of how such data can be analyzed. We attempted to perform some analysis on a computer mouse popularized by the gaming and professional services industries, the Logitech MX Master 3. Our goal was to find some key insights that Logitech can consider in future iterations of the mouse and to provide an example of how extracted data can be used in a business setting. We attempted this process using a variety of descriptive analytics and data visualizations, as well as to create a reputable NLP model to further analyze the customer reviews of this product. In the end, we ran into a variety of challenges that made us realize that we overestimated the usability of Amazon review data, particularly relating to the data itself being biased towards positive reviews, making it especially difficult to perform quality data analysis.
