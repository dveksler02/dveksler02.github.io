light medium usage charges It ~2 years AA powered get days However charging never get caught without batteries on-hand Also big kudos making charging port USB-C Customizations lacking For button except left right swap plenty choices Options Also controllable standard things like scroll speed direction wheels pointer speed smoothness The middle-wheel probably main \"physical\" attractions According floats magnets It configured spin freely I mean freely It extremely smooth negligible resistance continues spin long long flick wheel Or configured traditional ratchet Or configured combination ratchets go slowly spins freely give quick flick The middle-wheel Button customizations point scroll customizations split two categories global application specific This means customizations general system also customizations specific applications For example wanted scroll speed slower working Acrobat faster working Chrome browser set customizations automatically behave accordingly working applications This basic example actually full set button assignments point scroll options application You get creative customize You configure middle-wheel click application spin freely another application This level customization truly fantastic sets apart THE choice professionals pro applications living This ability pair three computers On bottom button allows manually

\"grip\" area palm &amp; thumb clicking surfaces fingers It feels nice Yeah I get moving hand around responsiveness excellent I suspect make getting screen captures easier moving pixel required clean trackball The button distribution behavior excellent I like wheel I want click variety free movement This Better still automatically switches depending fast spin excellent You control manually The wheel also clicks web browsing I long opening new tabs The introduction side-scroller taking getting I digging I also like context &amp; gesture button I sure I like defaults gestures controllable customizable The two buttons also customizable add functionality Overall way trackball hence interest changing I like behavior buttons The clicks solid satisfying squishy like I tried I would say I I going extremely happy I already depth functionality I got gift I happy user first generation almost 3 years briefly second generation The 3 step back ergonomics top \"flat\" previous models \"spike\" roughly thumb index finger poking hand making uncomfortable The button thumb impossible press since smaller The original button set press side thumb button raised surrounding surface The new model

press like I 1 See photo Generally comfortable The thumb wheel close thumb thumb needs move 1 cm touch side scroll The \"freespin\" spin long first generation It noticeably slower therefore stops earlier It little bit precise faster advertised While quieter scroll mushy react fast movements If anyone looking getting series better buying previous models especially since cheaper third model I since darkfield Although general outline kept design get improved greatly Compared previous versions 3 fits hand I quite long Personally I loved side buttons scroll So far design superior among series I clicker sound little softer make noise like previous ones I mainly especially 3D modeling I also couple times home gaming It compatible many games including FPS games like counterstrike games like Witcher Since I windows system I know would mac I recommend The device smoth It ability connect 3 devices plus con clicking sound loud I like clicky sound Long battery life fits hand The turn I called Customer Service said defected Will update review I get replacement It turns wheel locks powered spin freely turned So keep mind This awesome though - ergonomic sturdy Lots customization options productivity Highly recommend I fanatic control I kind scroll wheel years This ups game better ergonomics still could better - could Many configuration options I side scroll wheel default horizontal scroll zoom press scroll wheel minimize current window buttons back closing current tab window And four gesture commands available I refresh scroll top The wheel action best yet I app specific commands outlook firefox etc <br>Still positive I move laptop home office location usb receiver docking station I move seamlessly The old system run connect whenever location switched I also Anywhere 2S travel included LogiOptions configuration The negative LogiOptions sometimes run startup get custom configuration loaded Tried LogiOptions run startup reason So I hotkey run needed Minor

class=\"cr-translated-review-content aok-hidden\"> WHAT I LIKE:- The battery lasts forever It came partially charged I still recharged 2 weeks Although could I hour day So I happy battery life far - Very comfortable hold There several buttons controls techie high volume user I buttons But make comfortable - Very accurate fast response There almost lag computer The connection instant I observed lags yet The also different dpi settings change manually So higher dpi setting give accurate minute level performance - I absolutely fact come dongle truly wireless It built-in bluetooth connection simply connects computer bluetooth reason I dongle-free design I lost least 2-3 dongles wirelss makes useless So dongle-free design people like keep losing dongles WHAT I DON T LIKE:- While easy comfortable glides screen little large It looks like built people large hands So people small hands may find little big Otherwise excellent wireless Solid Has nice weight Looks slick fit hand perfectly works like magic This get It worth price I looking forward trying I always buy anyway last two M510s best standard 5 button wireless market opinion 3 ideal usage I explain My main issues are:#1 - major functions touted electromagnetic scroll wheel supposed go standard scrolling high speed \"free-scrolling\" scrolling faster automatically I find varies wildly whether happens depending program programs sometimes I intentionally try make high speed scroll sometimes sometimes To clear DOES every program I tried criteria detection criteria seems vary moment moment Maybe \" in\" loosens NOTE: This ameliorated manual \"mode switch\" button behind main scroll wheel takes long keep scrolling works #2 - My hands small side man Not ridiculously I wear medium-large gloves example feels \"too big\" comfortable reach buttons without changing hand position The thumb buttons particular suffer Again clarify I normally full sized laptop \"portable\" unreasonably tiny OK criticisms subjective especially #2 completely negated hands bigger mine : Everything else The build quality materials excellent There rattles shake everything put together tightly solidly The plastic body nice lightly textured plastic soft almost rubberized though I believe The buttons clicky positive engagement type way without obnoxious 4000 DPI sensor provides smooth accurate tracking surface thumb wheel allows scrolling tabs browser easily number functions apps like Photoshop Premiere etc battery life excellent I 12 hours day every day almost two weeks charge yet Overall I fan I wish tiny bit shorter
