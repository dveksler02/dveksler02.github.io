1,ak01,4,"I cannot comment on the value of this mouse as I got it through work.Very nice mouse, the rubbery texture feels nice and the ergonomics is great (assuming you are right handed). The scroll wheel has hyperscrolling, which allows you to unlock it for free spin, but also automatically free spins when you spin it fast enough. Love it, though it isn't super useful. There is a programmable thumb button, though it is a little awkward to press.Logitech has software for this mouse being Logitech Options+, where you can reprogram the buttons either in general or per application. I find it not worthwhile and buggy, as the profiles would bleed into each other, which would cause me to delete files, etc.",7-Dec-22
2,KC5,5,"Use for regular computer work and CAD. Works awesome, no issues, so quiet! Best mouse I have ever had. Worth the $",6-Dec-22
3,Joey,2,"This mouse is great from every perspective, but on new M1 Mac, even after doing all the suggested troubleshooting, this mouse lags. Sometimes to the point I put it away and get out the cheap travel mouse because that experience is better than the lag. Forget gaming... writing an email sucks when the cursor lags.",5-Dec-22
4,PE,5,This fully featured mouse is a real pleasure to use and the best one I've tried. The extra scroll device can be used to zoom and many other things. I like it much better than the Logitech ergonomic mouse because it fits my hand better and has more features. Well worth the cost.,5-Dec-22
5,Johnny,5,"I went from a 60g mouse to this thing and the difference is extremely noticeable. It takes more effort to push it around but it's worth it for all the extra functions. The infinite scrolling, the side scrolling, the thumb button on the base, and just how quiet the clicks are. It's a great office mouse for sure. The software even has DPI settings with 50DPI intervals. Great for people who are picky about that.",4-Dec-22
6,Anthony Mills,5,"I tried every mouse Logitech and others make.To me, this is by far the most ergonomic mouse on the market, hands down!",4-Dec-22
7,Repod,5,"This is my second mx mouse. The first i had for about 7 years. I had to replace it as the battery started dying.I use the bluetooth connection instead of the usb dongle provided as the dongle seems to have lag problems and responce issues.Game play is very responsive, using bluetooth.Having the ablility to use this on 3 different computers is a plus as i use it with my laptop when traveling.",4-Dec-22
8,JJ.,1,Another piece of junk. The wheel does not scroll properly and I started having “jittery episodes” where the mouse would lag all the time. Save yourself the headache.,3-Dec-22
9,ZikG,5,"Seriously nice, smooth and quiet mouse! Best for this price range for office and professional work. Even gaming. It's so good that I've typed this review using this exact mouse... ok ok not really but it's that close.",2-Dec-22
10,Dirk Gently,5,"It will plug and play for the side scroll feature. For locked down work computers/secure IT environments that permit standalone mice. It will try and prompt to download logi software, but it doesn’t need it to function fully.My work allows personal mice on some of our non air gapped computers and none of our enterprise software blocked it from functioning fully.That side scrolling is amazing and once you get used to it you’ll never be able to go back.",1-Dec-22
11,Eric L,4,"I've been using Master Mx mouse since they were first released and never had any issues with the unifying receiver, but  the new Bolt Receiver is very laggy unless the receiver is plugged directly into computer and the computer is next to the mouse.I have my laptop/docking station on the left side of my workstation and when the Bolt Receiver is plugged into the docking station the mouse movement is laggy/floaty  (I don't game with it, just normal business apps).  To resolve I had to get an 2ft USB extension and placed the Bolt Receiver directly in front of the mouse.While traveling, when the Bolt Receiver was plugged into a port replicator, the mouse also became laggy.  I had to plug the extension cable directly to the laptop to resolve.As others have mentioned, the mouse clicking doesn't have very much tactile feedback, but you get used to it right away.",29-Nov-22
12,Andres E. Alesii,5,"I loved this mouse so much!!! I bought one for home and one for the office. Completely customizable and it opened my eyes to the world of multiple desktops on Windows 11 and my MacBook Pro. Sure, you can use keyboard shortcuts that, but the gesture ability only this mouse offers makes you so much more efficient and productive. Love, love, love it!!! Thank you, Logitech!",29-Nov-22
13,Conrad B. Hart,5,My favorite mouse of all time.,27-Nov-22
14,Wayne Alexander,5,One thing about this mouse is it is dependable. It is speedy. I like the action because it is smooth and seamless. With the MX keyboard it is exactly the kind of tool that puts a capital P in a productive day. Thanks to the Logitech company this mouse and keyboard will most likely be the standard by which all others must compete.,27-Nov-22
15,Jefferson Rios Caro,5,"After a couple of months using it, I don't regret on each penny that expended on this mouse.Just a great product.",25-Nov-22
16,Donald King,5,This is the best mouse I have ever used,25-Nov-22
17,Nick G,5,I love all the features. Especially the thumb scroll. Great product.,25-Nov-22
18,KJL,5,I bought this as an alternative to my usual trackball and like it.,25-Nov-22
19,RV,5,"If you’re looking for a serious mouse that has it ALL then look no more.The ergonomics are spot on and let me use this mouse comfortably all day. I work hybrid - mostly out of my home office - but also go into work. This mouse is such a game changer I have the same one at work too. It was just too sad to use a “normal” mouse after making this upgrade.The buttons all have just the right amount of resistance and control that I like. Being able to customize the function of each button is also a huge plus. This lets you do things like browse through sites or scroll through large Excel worksheets very easily.The center scroll wheel is also cool since it is adjustable. You can scroll line-by-line or by disengaging the brake the wheel spins freely so you can scrolls hundreds of lines at a time.I have used other mice on my black desk at home and they all had occasional skips and tracking issues. Not this one though. It is super smooth and accurate. Tracking is also adjustable, which is a huge plus when you work with a large monitor.Overall, this mouse is just so good that it feels like a luxury but also gets the job done in style. Treat yourself and you’ll be glad you did!",25-Nov-22
20,Prolific baker,1,Was very surprised to find a cheaper model inside the original MX Master S3 box. The nub was also missing. A 30 dollar difference between the models. Will be returning,24-Nov-22
21,LaTosha Trotter,2,The mouse was okay until they short keys would not stay programmed I kept having to reprogrammed the button for short keys,23-Nov-22
22,AekinJay,5,"First, this is not a gaming mouse... yes logitech is known for gaming gear, but that isn't the purpose of this mouse.  It's made for designers like me.  It has a precision level that is virtually unparalleled and a responsiveness that is amazing.  Sure, you could probably play some casual games with it, but action and fps type games are out.  This mouse can pair with up to 3 systems and has all the functions that I want for designing in SolidWorks or Fusion 360 and seems to have pretty amazing battery life.  Using the logibolt + software I can customize the functions depending on if I'm doing CAD design or using Photoshop or Illustrator.  For what I use it for I can easily give it a 5 out of 5.",23-Nov-22
23,Josh,4,"I use middle click a lot. I find that this mouse cogs over to scroll up/down as I try to open a link in a new tab, and has been one thing I dislike about it. The ability to enable/disable free scrolling is nice, but the detents are not strong enough for me.<br>The mouse is also small, and does not provide much for angle on the hand to reduce wrist fatigue. It does work for a palm grip, but I find myself clicking accidentally if my fingertips are hanging over the end of the mouse.Otherwise, it's fantastic. I may change the side scroll to be up/down scroll, and disable the up/down wheel on top</br>",22-Nov-22
24,Nisarga Ravi Kumar,1,Sensor of mouse isn't working properly from day one,21-Nov-22
25,David,4,"Great mouse, great feel, but sadly, the unit I got was used. It is in excellent condition and I don't think returning this will be worth the effort.",21-Nov-22
26,Teddy T Taylor,5,This by far is the best mouse I have own,21-Nov-22
27,Joe,1,"I'm an Amazon Prime member.  The shipping time on this item was unacceptable.  I went to the manufacturer's site and paid $8 more for 2 day shipping and got 6%  back on my VISA. Prime is disappointing lately. Anyway, I did some research, and this is the mouse I need for audio &amp; video editing, site design, programming, surfing, and some light gaming because I'm nearly 50 and my mouse is definitely not the reason you're winning.",20-Nov-22
28,M,5,Logitech MX Master 3S is quite simply the best wireless BlueTooth mouse I have ever owned. It is extremely customizable and ergonomic!,19-Nov-22
29,Zachary Tripp,5,"I lobe this mouse, its incredible. I can switch between my computer amd tablet with only one click",19-Nov-22
30,Robert A. Neverdon Jr.,5,I love how it integrates with my new Lenovo ThinkPad,18-Nov-22
31,Brutus,4,"1:  I needed to return the 1st and get a second. The 1st wouldn't hold a charge at all.2: You can switch devices, up to 3 of them... but in order to do that, you need to puck the mouse up and click on a button on the bottom is it.... while, I feel lazy writing this and ""complaining"" about it...... Ease of Function would allow for me to click perhaps on the right side with my pinky to switch... or, the left side thumb rest area.... I don't want to pick it up, I want to seemlessly switch between devices.",18-Nov-22
32,Amazon Customer,5,"This thing is built for speed and comfort. I never write reviews, but felt compelled to share a little about this baby. The scroll wheel is smooth as Amish butter and the clicks are so quiet I wish they could teach my kids a lesson. The thumb scroll turns excel docs into a video game, and don't get me started on being able to copy/paste with the 2 thumb buttons. I wasn't sure about spending 100 bucks on a mouse, but man did I not know what I was missing. Top notch.",17-Nov-22
33,S. Khan,4,"I absolutely dislike the vertical scroll wheel. Otherwise this thing feels great and is absolutely silent on clicks. Love the rechargeable nature of it, coming from previous Logitech mice that required batteries. Feels great on the palm and wrist.",17-Nov-22
34,SGA,1,"I bought this mouse on September 20, 2022. Yesterday, November 15, 2022, I was working as usual when the mouse cursor started shaking my screen. I thought maybe it was my computer or just one of those strange things that sometimes happen with technology. I plugged the mouse in to charge, turned it on and off, disconnected and reconnected it, and even left it alone for the rest of the day. This morning, November 16, 2022, I went back to see if the issue went away, and now it won't even turn on. It's completely dead; nothing lights up. I spent over $100 on this, which was not worth it. I'm glad I got the warranty.",17-Nov-22
35,Bxstrb,5,"I was skeptical at first paying this much for a mouse but wow it's the best mouse I've ever owned. It connected with very little effort using the bolt dongle and I love the customization options. Some thoughts:- The horizontal scroll wheel is pretty handy though it takes a little getting used to. I kept hitting the two buttons underneath it instead.- The thumb button is fantastic at it's default setting to see an overview of all my open windows. Sometimes it's hard to activate but maybe I just need to get used to it as well.- I love the ability to change how the vertical wheel scrolls. It's extremely quick- Ergonomically, this fits my hand like a glove. It's perfect for me.All in all, completely happy with this purchase.",15-Nov-22
36,Dan,1,"I sent this back weeks ago and still haven't been refunded by Amazon! I used the amazon locker and not a single email or confirmation. Very shady if you ask me and no confirmation or anything after this long means I have to contact them,,, again...The mouse has micro stutters that drives you crazy and the IR has to be plugged into a usb 2 port which is getting more rare these days as we move passed even usb 3. I did have a slot however after removing another item that needed usb 2 and the stutters were just too much to deal with. Back to a nice, smoooooth plug in mouse that doesn't care where it's plugged in.",15-Nov-22
37,Kj Sapp,5,I love the shape of the mouse and how the fit just feels so natural.,15-Nov-22
38,Nicholas,1,"mouse wheel is horrible. 2S is way better, mouse click is no longer sharp any more. less than 30 days of use.",15-Nov-22
39,Paul Bloem,4,"The mouse is a delight to use, and the scroll wheel is unmatched in any mouse I've ever used. The only oversight is the location of the Easy Switch button. The Marathon mouse has the button to switch between connected computers right near the thumb and it's great. The button on this mouse is on the bottom and requires flipping the mouse over to swap. Not a big enough issue for me to return it, I'm usually only using one computer at a time, but it seems like a strange miss for a company that's usually fantastic at this stuff.",14-Nov-22
40,John Jones,1,"Worked awesome for about a month.  Then, for no reason at all, the pointer gets choppy and bounces all over the screen.  I've tried every internet fix and tried every setting.  It gets better for a few minutes and goes back to bouncing all over.  Of course, this all started just after the return window closed.  I'm out $100 for what has turned out to be a worthless piece of junk.  Thanks Logitech",14-Nov-22
41,River Eastburn,5,"This mouse is awesome. Btw if you were wondering if the ""pale grey"" model is PURE white, like the photos, it isn't.",14-Nov-22
42,Showtime,5,Good mouse. Wrist is noticeably more comfortable,13-Nov-22
43,Robert,5,"UpDate: One issue with my Logitech MX Master 3S.The right click needs more firmness to use properly.  I find the button clicks frequently from my finger resting on that button, thus bringing up a menu selection window.  4 layers of paper towel slipped into the case stopped the issue. I can still activate that right click with a firmer push.  I plan to make and slip a thin silicone piece into the gap to solve the unintentional clicking.  I also bought a Logitech Signature M650 L Full Size Wireless Mouse with same issue and utilized the same paper towel solution to stop unintentional right clicks.  For more info: internet search: Unintentional Right Mouse Clicking.I was really dubious about spending $100 on a mouse after using over a dozen inexpensive mice.  I know now why I should have moved up the mouse technology scale long ago.  The pointer precision of the the MX Masters 3S is amazing.  The pointer smoothness across two screens on my world map mouse pad(and other surfaces) is exceptional.  Using the 3S mouse with my architectural drawing program(and other software) just confirms the justification of owning this mouse.One item I'll have to investigate further is, can the rechargeable lithium battery be replaced in the future.My only wish would be that the 3S had a bit more mass/weight to it.  I just happen to like a heavier mouse, but I'll quickly adjust to this one.So, bottom line, I'm more than pleased with my acquisition of the MX MASTER 3S !!",12-Nov-22
44,Michael Bennett,5,Just a little too big for me.,12-Nov-22
45,Noah Lykins,5,"SUMMARY: I bought the 3s for the quiet clicks. It is pretty much silent... now I feel like my laptop keyboard is loud ha!PROS: The new Logi Options + app has a clean UI, it's easy to navigate and modify settings. Mouse functions well, the sensor tracks great on all the surfaces I've used it on. I use 1600 DPI. Smooth scroll functionality and the mag wheel are good as usual. Battery life rocks even on Bluetooth connection, and the 3s charges via USB C.CONS: Smaller than the first gen Master. The 3s leaves a bit less space for my pinkie finger, but this may be something that just takes time to get used to. The middle wheel on the first gen had soft rubber texturing which is missing on the 3s - makes me have a nails-on-chalkboard sensory experience when I first touch the well. Last pitfall - the thumb gesture button feels mushy and requires too much pressure to operate in a smooth workflow imo.",10-Nov-22
46,Scott Holm,5,"This mouse is great. It feels comfortable in your hand and like a premium product. It has a nice heft to it, and the details of the metal scroll wheels are great. The rubber is soft and grippy without feeling cheap. The buttons are responsive and clicky. Switching between computers with the Bluetooth selector is seamless and fast.Highly recommend this mouse for productivity tasks. I don’t do a ton of gaming, so I’m not sure how great it is for it.",9-Nov-22
47,Orkhan,5,Awesome for working,9-Nov-22
48,Tate,5,"This mouse has been a game changer at work! Love the side scroll and ability to customize controls for different apps. A coworker has the MX Master 3 and aside from the soft clicking with the 3s, I didn’t notice a significant difference in functionality.At the time of writing the MX Master 3 is going for around 69.99. If you don’t mind the clicking sound that a normal mouse makes, that might be something to consider.Takeaway:MX Master 3 makes clicking sound. MX Master 3s has same functionality but with soft clicking.",9-Nov-22
49,Nicole Violani Toppel,5,"This mouse is perfect for my medium/large hands. Great comfort and easy to use all day. They updated the 3S to have silent clicks, incredible! I love this mouse.",8-Nov-22
50,Schrekie,5,Super quiet clicks. LOVE IT!!!,8-Nov-22
51,Amazon Customer,5,"I bought this to edit photos, I was doing a large batch after a trip to Italy, and was getting cramps in my right hand with my old mouse. This is much more comfortable, and I can spend hours without cramping. I am not a gamer so I can't comment on it's gaming functions",8-Nov-22
52,Mark Greiner,1,"This mouse disconnected/ made itself inactive in the logo options app after a month of having it.  It would not allow me to disconnect it from Bluetooth and would not work. The  when reaching out to support, they were unhelpful. My $15 mouse before this one I had for well over a year and still works.  Don’t waste your money.",7-Nov-22
53,Nick S,5,I was a big fan of the anywhere mouse. One of the best mouses you can get. This is like that mouse but bigger on the hand which makes it more comfortable. Has more custom settings and it seems to work even better. Really like the look. Good job build on an already good mouse. 5 stars and would recommend to anyone.,7-Nov-22
54,Celebration-FL,3,"I'm searching and searching for a new mouse as my new MacBook Pro doesn't have a regular USB port for my old mouse.  The MX Master 3S is too large for me (5'2"" women with average hand size).  I can't rest my wrist on the desk when using it and thus it won't work for me.Logitech why why why don't you make a smaller version of the MX Master series for people who don't have large hands?!?!  Women probably make up around 50% of  your customer base.  Why are we ignored and made to have to use inferior mice just because are hands are smaller.  I'd happily pay more for a good quality full feature mouse that fits in my hand.",7-Nov-22
55,Di Song,5,Perfect for work.  Too heavy for gaming,6-Nov-22

<span> Using MX 3 Master (without ""S"") with no issues and like itBut this one have a very laud scroll sound. Hate using it ;(",4-Nov-22
58,Sara Sackner,2,When I first got this mouse 6 months ago it was like flying the space shuttle - I loved it and the battery lasted for days before recharge. Now I can only use it for an hour or two after charging over night. Too bad it does not have a swappable AA battery so I could keep one in the charger. For $100 this is not worth it until they fix this very basic issue.,4-Nov-22
59,Matthew Smith,1,"bring back the original mx master 3 at least it workedthis mouse is a frankenstein of the mx master 3 some of the buttons are silent, some of the buttons are louder than the original mx3, and some of the buttons are so hard to push that they are useless.the 2 main buttons are almost silentthe 2 side buttons are not silent and a little louder than the originalthe center scroll is not silentthe thumb button is almost impossible to press and no feedback to know if you pressed it",4-Nov-22
60,Shea,2,"I have loved the mouse, until now a little over a year later and it will no longer hold a charge for more than a day without having to be recharged where prior it had several months with the same usage. When I contacted Logitech about the issue with the mouse, they said they won't do anything about it. So keep that in mind. It's only good for about a year before it has to stay plugged in to be usable.",3-Nov-22
61,jordan chambers,5,"With the robust customization and features you can do with this mouse it makes everything more efficient when doing work, gaming, or just browsing the web. For most people they might be turned off by the price, but for the hardcore enthusiast like myself this is a must have. Would highly recommend adding this to your desk.",2-Nov-22
62,Cristian,5,Great product,1-Nov-22
63,Antony Steele,5,"I am enjoying the use of the Logitech MX Master 3S Wireless Mouse. For a ""regular mouse"", (non gaming), it is the absolute best I have ever used. It is a little too heavy for FPS gaming, but it can work in a pinch. For anything else, it is head and shoulders above anything I have used before. I used to just buy the Logitech M510 wireless Mouse, but they go bad in about 6 Months with heavy MS Excel usage. This 3S mouse may be a little too big to put in a briefcase or backpack in terms of portability, but it is great for desktop usage. This is a little expensive, yes, but I am not regretting the purchase. If you use your mouse professionally, I do not think you would regret the purchase of this. I am using the 2.4 Mhz USB dongle, as Bluetooth is not for me. The battery charge lasts for weeks. Very pleased with this after about a Month of usage.",1-Nov-22
64,Tabitha Perry,1,Had a bad connection and skipped and missed a lot!,1-Nov-22
65,Lamda,5,"I never thought I'd find a mouse with a similar feel as my trusty old Logitech G403, but this excels in every way. This mouse performs every gesture of the lovely MacBook Pro trackpad, but with greater precision and ease of use. In fact, it does far _more_ than the outstanding Apple trackpad.For example, the ""hidden"" gesture button where your thumb naturally rests allows you to quickly zoom in and out (the equivalent of a two-finger tap on the trackpad). By holding down the button with your thumb, you can move the mouse up or down to toggle Mission Control/App Exposé, or move the mouse left/right to swipe between desktops. It even supports rotation.Everything is easily configurable using the intuitive Logi Options+ app. You can also customize every button/scroll per application; so for example, in Chrome, you can use the horizontal wheel to move between tabs.The toggle button underneath the scroll wheel switches between infinite scrolling or ratchet scrolling by default. But it's also software configurable! My personal preference is to hold the toggle button down in macOS for quickly zooming in and out and to use the ""thumb"" button for desktop gestures (or vice versa).The material quality and design are top-notch. The click ""feeling"" is ultra-premium and quiet.I'm using it on Windows 11 and macOS Ventura (MacBook Pro M1 Max) with dual 4K monitors at 120Hz/144Hz.I've only used the Flow option briefly. It seemed a little clunky, but that's understandable with a beta OS. It was certainly easier to set up than Synergy.On macOS beta, I encountered some latency initially with an external 4K monitor at 144Hz. The cursor would freeze up temporarily. Disabling handoff in Settings resolved that issue (presumably because macOS is polling to see if there's an iPad nearby when the mouse approaches the edge of the screen).There was also some latency when using the Bolt dongle on my Dell Thunderbolt 3 dock; moving the USB dongle to my monitor on the other side of my desk did the trick. These are typical Bluetooth issues but should be improved with Bolt. Either way, it's been working flawlessly for the last month now on Windows and macOS Ventura.If you're a software engineer or work in graphics, CAD, etc., this is a must-have.",31-Oct-22
66,H.M. ElMostrito,5,"Pros:Aside from the specs, there are some subtle aspects of this mouse that make it stand over the reset. For instance, the magnetic wheel scroll makes it really convenient to scroll up/down in long pages. Give it a quick roll and the roller will disengage its magnet and scroll all the way to the end. No more annoying roller strokes.The Options+ software is very stable and makes it very convenient to assign macros to specific applications. It's incredibly stable as well, always detecting the program you're using and adjusting to it.I got the Business edition which has the Bolt dongle. As far as I know, the 8K resolution is complete overkill, even on a 3 monitor setup even the 4K resolution on the regular edition is overkill, but that's just me.Cons:I initially got this to sync 3 PCs to replace MouseWithoutBorders with the ""Flow"" feature, but the transition from PC to PC is far from seamless. Sometimes you have to continuously slide the mouse to the edge for the software to pick it up and switch to the next computer. I'm not exaggerating here... it's really bad to the point I have to manually toggle it, from both the keyboard and the mouse. Sometimes the mouse switches over but doesn't carry the keyboard with it, I have to manually toggle the keyboard. After tying this for an entire day, I went back to MouseWithoutBorders and learned to appreciate its stability.Warning:1. If you already have an MX Keys, it will be better off if you get a matching edition because they'll share the same dongle (standard keyboard and standard mouse vs business/business).2. if you get the white version, you might have to clean it after every use, because the rubber finish makes it a magnet for skin cells.3. If you get it for gaming, you might find it a bit on the ""Clunky"" side. Then again, this is not sold as a gaming mouse. With all the buttons/macros, this is great for office work, like software development.Hope this helps.",30-Oct-22
67,B,5,good ergonomic feel and nicely responsive,30-Oct-22
68,Anthony Baumer,5,"The device is extremely easy to setup and use. The clicks are very quiet, smooth, and enjoyable to use. The scroll wheel is precise, fast, and works with ease. The device has the best fit and feel of any mouse that is out there as it feels like it was personally molded to fit your hand.",29-Oct-22
69,Mamounfj ,5,This is an excellent mouse.But the side wheel customization is difficult on some computers. And the side wheel software could give you a headache or might not work. But overall I recommend this mouse. I liked a lot how long it lasts with one charge. I wish if the mouse size is a little bigger. Also I wish if the side buttons are lower and larger. The side wheel feels great. But good luck getting it to give the custom commands you prefer.,28-Oct-22
70,Tom,1,"When in ""ratcheting mode"" the scroll wheel frequently,  like 4/5 times, gets itself in a position to scroll forever. Apparently very poor quality, for the money I'm absolutely shocked. Returned in less than 48 hours.",28-Oct-22

72,Ricardo,4,"Fits really well into my hand, much less strain than the mouse that came with my PC.I love the extra buttons but they need to have more options that what is currently allowed. The left scroll does not go left to right on my on-screen take-off software, it's just another zoom, that only goes out but not in---so kind of a bummer. ---Dear Logitech, can this issue be fixed in an update?Having a dedicated copy/paste buttons is a game changer though!Otherwise, the best part is the quiet clicks - drove me batty to hear all the click, click, clicking noise all day long.I do have concerns that the battery did not fully charge to 100%, only got to 90% with it plugged in all night.  Based on my first day of usage, I used 5% of the battery today. So it should last pretty long between charges. But I am wondering why it did not fully charge?Overall very nice mouse, big improvement from a basic one, but it does need a few tweaks/updates to make it 5 star worthy imho.",27-Oct-22
73,Brian,4,"I love this mouse. This mouse is a great deal, some mice are more expensive than this and this is a good deal. I wanted to use this with my work laptop only as that's what I needed it for. Ergonomics, amazing. Scroll wheel, best one out there. Click sound took some time to get used to. The issue that I had to return it was that I wasn't able to customize the mouse. My company and many others don't allow you to download personal software onto your work device, so I couldn't use any of the customization with the mouse. If you are allowed to download the software, I'd buy it immediately. It's definitely not a gamer mouse, feel or use. But a ergonomic work mouse, great",27-Oct-22
74,Laena,3,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on the mouse, as it has been hailed by many reviewers as the best productivity mouse out there.PROS• The build quality is top-notch. The material used feels grippy which prevents slipping• The buttons are tactile and solid. Horizontal scroll wheel is a great addition• Logi Option+ app adds even more customisation and shortcuts to enhance productivity per appCONS• I cannot believe how laggy the pointer is on MacOS. I've tried tweaking pointer speed and DPI but nothing seems to work• I am also unable to update the firmware, which is weird for a recently released product. Same applies to the MX Keys Mini keyboard• USB A receiver doesn't make any sense, when this was built with Mac in mind. My MacBook Pro 14"" has x3 USB C ports, which means I have to use an adapter. Same goes for charging.Overall, I'm slightly disappointed with this mouse. For a $100 mouse, it shouldn't be as laggy as a $20 mouse. I'm seriously considering returning this mouse, and getting something else as the choppy pointer impedes my productivity.All this is after a full day of use across Windows and MacOS over bluetooth and USB receiver. I feel like the cons outweighs the pros.",26-Oct-22

80,Filipe Ferro,3,"love this mouse, however, there is one major issue.. the main scroll wheel (the one on top for vertical scrolling) is unresponsive... with either the USB or Bluetooth connection, it will become unresponsive and lag if you quickly switch between scrolling up and down... e.g. I'm quickly moving up and down with the scroll wheel and it translates to almost zero motion on the screen... this shouldn't happen on any mouse, let alone a high-end mouse from an awesome company like Logitech.I've tried changing the settings in the Options Plus control panel, disabling/enabling smooth scrolling, and pressing the button on top to switch between the Ratchet and Free Spin options; none of these changes fixed the issue.It's unfortunate that the vertical scroll wheel has this issue, because it's otherwise perfect. The unresponsiveness when suddenly changing direction on the scroll wheel was driving me crazy, so I had to return it. I really hope there's some way to fix this, but I've heard from others that Logitech does not even acknowledge the issue :( I really would've loved to keep it if it didn't have this critical flaw.",23-Oct-22

The buttons on the side are handy for going forward or backward through the progression of sites you have just seen. The left and right main buttons for clicking on things feel fantastic -- only a light touch is needed, but they have great tactile feedback, so using them is effortless and easy to control. The scroll wheel feels great and works great, and you can choose smooth or clicky scrolling. The scroll speed and cursor movement speed are adjustable over a wide range. The horizontal wheel for your thumb works great. And it feels very comfortable in my hand.

89,Maynard,5,"I was tired of the magic mouse. I only liked the ability to swipe/tap the magic mouse to go between desktops and whatnot. Oh and the scrolling; the soft scrolling on magic mice is actually really good.The ability to customize the MX Master 3S (newest version) and all its benefits makes this mouse a lot better than the magic mouse. The gesture button allows me to swipe between desktops. It takes a little getting used to but feels natural in no time. Along with the gesture button, there are two thumb buttons that defaults to back and forward in your browser. Right above the 2 thumb buttons, there's a horizontal scroll wheel. On top of the mouse, you have the standard 3 buttons for right, left, and a middle clicking vertical scroll wheel. Right under the scroll wheel is another button that allows you change the type of scrolling function from smooth to ratchet or the clicky line by line kind of scrolling. Underneath, you'll find a slider to select the connection method (bluetooth/usb) as well as a button to be able to connect your mouse to 3 separate systems. In the very front of the mouse is a USB-C port for charging. I haven't tested if this also allows another method of connecting to your system.All these buttons are fully customizable using the Logi Options+ app. From the app, you control everything. You can also setup different customization profiles per app and switching is seamless. You don't have to do any activating.I'm also using this for gaming. Sometimes I need to switch from my mac to my windows laptop and the selector button on the bottom makes that simple. It is a bit annoying that I have to lift the mouse and push the button, but you can also have any of the other buttons perform this function.Smooth scrolling works well, but it doesn't beat the magic mouse scrolling. I'm not sure what it is, but if you don't really care about having the scrolling silky smooth, it won't be an issue. As I mentioned above, there's smooth and ratchet scrolling. A button beneath the scroll wheel allows you to easily select.It's only been 6 days and the battery is at 70%. I'm on my laptop longer than I should be, pulling 8-9 hour work days, and gaming for 2-3 hours after that. I do a lot of switching between desktops, scrolling pages, and play WoW and CoD. Battery life seems to be really solid. No complaints there so far. Plus the charge port is in the front of the mouse so you can still use it.All in all, I love this mouse. I can get my work done, then play my games right after.",19-Oct-22

It was what Amazon had in stock, so I bought it because I wanted the upgraded USB C charging and didn't want to carry around more cables with my laptop.  One cable to rule them all and in the bag, bind them.Needless to say, the white non-slip grip on the outside of the mouse is a MAGNET for hand grease.

100,JBen2015,5,"The mx series mice are a favorite of many people for a reason! I love this thing! It works as expected. My only complaint is that to get full functionality you need Logitech's software for this mouse. Not terrible but I use this primarily for work so that software probably isn't gonna be installed on the primary device it'll be used on. It's worth the price despite that limitation Logitech put on it. I don't know why Amazon is asking about gaming performance as a rating category, that's dumb and isn't remotely what this mouse is for, if you want a good gaming mouse, maybe buy a GAMING mouse, maybe the G502 but certainly not this. It's a very good mouse for its intended purpose, productivity. Scroll wheel on top and left side are excellent, very useful for looking at excel workbooks. Forward and backwards buttons are great too, work exactly as expected. I do recommend this mouse for literally anything but gaming. Lol",17-Oct-22

Everything else is not.* if you buy the grey version, the coating becomes visibly dirty very fast.* The back-and-forth buttons are touching the thumb. The back button is so far back it forces one to slide the hand back just for the click.* The thumb down button is limited to a tiny, easy to miss, area, making it uncomfortable to use.* The main buttons have less tactile feel.* The dongle is USB-A, not USB-C. You need an adapter to use with a laptop* The charging indicator is a single LED. You can't estimate the charge left with a glance.I am sticking to 2S.",17-Oct-22

My desktop is wired in and my laptop is connected to the wifi 5ghz option. When I enable flow, it does not read both computers as connected. They flicker on and off and if they are recognized at all.

Everything was great on the first day, but I almost returned it the 2nd day because I realized the Bluetooth would not reconnect after disconnection, requiring me to re-pair the device. (I did not have this problem with the older MX Master.)HOWEVER: It turned out my computer had an updated Bluetooth driver that fixed this! So now I'm happy.I do think Lenovo should find a workaround for this because it appears a lot of people run into this problem, and clearly it's not unavoidable (given the older MX Master worked fine). However, I wanted to post here to tell everyone: if your Bluetooth disconnects with this mouse, please try updating your computer's Bluetooth driver before returning the mouse!",29-Sep-22

151,TGomez,4,"Bought this to replace a MX Master 2 mouse. I use it with a Mac. I mostly love it, with the one downside being that when I first wake the computer from sleep the LogiTech software is a little slow to activate my mouse preferences. For example, I set my vertical scroll to Standard (rather than the default of Natural). But when I first start using the mouse after wake, it uses Natural for about 4 seconds and then finally switches over to my set preference.1",27-Sep-22

154,Scott,3,"For those who are truly looking for a mouse to help with their debilitating Carpal Tunnel, I'm just as disappointed as you are when I say this is not the one. Read on, I am a carpal tunnel sufferer with years of experience and numerous mice. Long story short, absolutely go for Logitech's Vertical Mice instead.I am currently an owner of over 20 modern mice, years of peripheral experience, all with varying uses, from productivity, ergonomics, and gaming.I'm always on the hunt for the best mouse for each job, and when I was struck with hard hitting Carpal Tunnel in 2017, it's been a real pain to find the right mouse for the job.The MX Master3S is a beautiful mouse. Probably one of the most comfortable shapes I've ever held. The shape and soft material feel like they melt into your hand, and the clicks of every button feels incredibly gentle and tactile. It definitely feels like a luxury mouse in your hand, no doubt about it. It is very palm-grip oriented, and has a very strange design choice on the rear, as it drops off, leaving you either levitating your hand, or drooping your hand... which is terrible for your wrist and negates all ergonomics. I also wish mouse developers would put more space for a pinky rest. Either they design it with the middle finger being placed on the mouse wheel, or they are just letting your pinky drag on the mouse pad.However, I'm reviewing from a Carpal Tunnel sufferer's perspective. I work at home by day, bike for exercise and game by night, so my wrist is always burnt out. This mouse sadly does not alleviate it at all, and in fact aggravates it. Now, does it worsen it as bad as a typical flat gaming mouse? No. But it does not benefit , or promote healing in any way. The gesture function is also reliant on a hidden thumb button, and the action to press down and activate it again, does no favors for your wrist or exhausted thumb muscles.As a productivity mouse, and for overall comfort with those with healthy wrists, this is an amazing mouse.For gaming, it is far too heavy for fast paced games. For those who just want a general multitasking mouse for casual gaming, it's a decent choice. But I'd recommend just getting a Logitech G502 for a similar shape, with way more functionality at that point.For Carpal Tunnel. No, just no. It's such a beautiful design and really I am bummed that I'm going to consider returning this, but it's the word 'ergonomic' slapped onto a pretty typical pronated wrist design, and will NOT help your wrist. I confidently guarantee ignoring my warning that you'll be pretty 'sore'ly disappointed.I recommend their 2 Vertical Mice in the end, as the only true way to aid in the healing of Carpal tunnel is to stop pronating your wrist, pinching the nerve in the tunnel and inflaming it. Vertical mice keep your bones from overlapping, and keep an open carpal tunnel, which aids in healing and prevents further aggravating to certain extents.Greatmouse. Bad Carpal Tunnel Mouse.",26-Sep-22

156,D. Clark,1,"Over one hour of chat to try a fix an problem. The Tech sent me link after link after link that had nothing to do with my mouse. Her direction to click on links on the web pages she had me click on - did not exist. The delay in my responses and her's were several minutes.Over one hour. I have owned many Logitech items over the years. The device worked fine for three months and then it didn't.Tech's trouble shooting didn't fix the issue.I requested a new mouse. I supplied my info she requested to obtain a new mouse.The tech told me that my request would have to go through serveral reviews to see if a replacement would be authorized.Man, Logitech Tech support trouble shooting is worse than the device problems.Next time, if a Logitech item breaks.....I will just buy a similar product from another supplier.Based on their tech support, I will never buy another product from them.A warranty is only good if the Tech support person knows what they are doing.",25-Sep-22
157,Trevor S,5,I use this mouse between 3 computers daily. The new silent click is amazing and very helpful when on video meetings!I use it between a windows machine (using the included USB adapter) and use it with 2 macs via bluetooth. The transitions are seamless and I have loved using it. The battery life seems to be very good as I have not yet had to charge it after several weeks of use.,24-Sep-22

159,Amanda,5,"This is my absolute favorite mouse.  I had an older version (that I stole from my husband) and it worked great however it didn't have a silent click.  I do a lot of meetings and I was always worried about people hearing the ""click"" from the mouse.  I just got this mouse in and it's great.  The click is silent, the left and right scroll is slightly higher than the previous model, but it's easy to adjust to.  Fits great even though I have a smaller hand.  Would recommend this mouse to anyone looking for a silent click, with scrolls in all directions, and comfortable fit.",24-Sep-22
160,Jacob Nichols,4,"This is a fantastic mouse but IMO there are 2 drawbacks that kind of cooncide. First, if anything accidental happens Logitech or Amazon do not cover that in a protection plan and second, there are no spare parts so if it breaks you have to buy a new one and for the cost you would think they could help in some way. I dropped it and thought I broke the scroll wheel so I called a few rapair shops and Logitech. Most repair shops don't work on mice and neither does Logitech. If you find spare parts online they are from random second hand people and may not work so they are sketchy. Luckily after talking on the phone with customer service at Logitech she had me blow air into the wheel and everything worked again, so you can say it's quite durable. Also, there are no scuffs or scratches after dropping it. Would recommend and would absolutely buy again, it's very difficult to go back to a regular mouse now.",23-Sep-22

It's nice to choose, with a push of a button, scrolling line-by-line or free-range. You can give the wheel a quick turn to quickly travel up or down a page. The backward screen button is not in a comfortable place and seems awkward.",22-Sep-22
165,Garrett Daniel,3,"I fell in love with the original MX Master 3. We have two in our house and now that I am back in the office, I ordered another mouse, this time the MX Master 3s given it looked to be an upgrade and the non ""S"" version was out of stock. The 3s feels numb with less tactile buttons and thumb wheel feels like its rolling through something sticky (think molasses) . As a result I am double clicking unintentionally. I use the MX keys (non-mechanical) so I'm not the person who usually wants incredibly positive feedback or overly tactile response, but the current feel is just too vague. Mouse looks great and the function you get from it is still well beyond other mouses.",22-Sep-22

I think I might have to toss it. So frustrated after months of using and just not being able to get used to a scroll wheel that doesn't work right. It's either way too slow, or way too fast. The finger motion I'd normally use to scroll ten lines instead scrolls just 1 line. The motion I'd normally use to scroll 20 lines scrolls 200 lines. Nothing in-between, all or nothing.

It's a nice gift because it's the kind of think most people couldn't stand spending that kind of money on for themselves, but will really love how much better it is to use than a standard/cheap one.  It's comfy, not too cluttered with buttons, the horizontal scroll is pretty nice actually, and i definitely have used the app over time, to customize a few buttons for some apps, which is very nice.  (Clicking the mouse wheel to open a new explored window with Ctrl+N is quite nice now that i'm used to it.)I also do use the switch on the bottom between multiple computers, it's a useful feature you might not think about (though... alas, as much as i tried to reprogram the switch to one of the top buttons, it's not possible).The scroll wheel is also very nice and once you get used to it you will probably be slightly bothered using other less solid feeling ones.  All around just a high quality daily driver that i've used for at least a year now and am really glad i went a little extra for a product that is actually high quality.(also... i told myself i needed to post a positive review since i just trashed another horrible purchase and am worried about the ""negative feedback"" bias, so this was the maybe the most approved thing in my history i picked.)",12-Sep-22

Truth be told, I’ve been hearing about it in different circles for years. I finally took the plunge and couldn’t be happier. It’s been flawless. I have zero lag. And that’s with using it between 2 PCs, via Multiplicity. The dedicated side scroll wheel is a very welcome addition for me, as I practically live in Excel. Profile switching is easy enough if I need it (I usually don’t, as I use my old M 720 as a travel mouse). The quiet buttons are also very pleasant and I don’t miss loud mouse clicks (although I like the sound of my mechanical keyboard so you’ll have to figure that one out…).

202,Alexacology,4,"Looking for a mouse? Debating on this one or another one? Don't bother. This one is the winner.1. Ergonomic - it's ergonomic AF. My hand is super comfortable on it all day at the computer - for reference I do Revit and AutoCAD along with other design programs that requires heavy use of the mouse. I'm not a gamer but I think the same principles apply (or maybe they don't lol).2. Quiet - I never thought I'd ever care about my mouse being quiet. Well, now I can't go back. The clicks are soft and quiet but it still ""clicks"" in an extremely satisfying manner where you know you clicked on something. The top scroll and side scroll - AMAZING. They are made out of metal which gives it a lovely, heavier weight to them than any other mouse I've used. They both scroll softly and smoothly. The way they feel under your fingers is chef's kiss.3. Customization - you can also customize how you want the clicks and the scrolls to work. This gives me the opportunity to customize the mouse in a way that is perfect for me. Love that the two buttons near my thumb can be copy and paste because I do a lot of that.4. Bluetooth - This is where I had to knock off a star. The bluetooth connection for this mouse was very spotty for me. I don't know if I got a defective mouse but the bluetooth connection would not hold after the computer and the mouse would go to sleep. I had to manually reconnect the mouse to the computer but eventually, even that stopped working. I am currently using the usb and this has worked great.Overall, I would still recommend this mouse 100% because of its functionality and design. I can't over emphasize how wonderfully quiet this mouse is but still satisfying to use. I swear you will never want to go back to a loud clicky mouse ever again. Maybe you won't have the bluetooth issue but again, since they give you the usb backup method, I can still use the mouse with no issues.",6-Sep-22

Out of the many mice I have used over the years, for all these varies things, this mouse by far makes things smoother no matter the surface your using, the DPI you set, or the number of devices you use. I have found the customization of the mice buttons very easy to setup and use, the functional use of multi-device use (could have used a better way to switch between them), and the functions utalized via the Options+ with the copy+paste features. I have just bought the matching MX keyboard to go along with this and am considering the webcam as well. I don't know why I ever left Logitech...

210,Asiano Montoya,2,"I have been using an MX Revolution for over a decade now.  It recently started acting up so it was a no brainer to look at another mouse from the MX series.  All the reviews were stellar for the Master 3 so it was a no brainer.  I had hoped it would be my mouse for the next decade, but I ended up returning it.The pros.-Well packaged.-Quality looks amazing-The hyper-scroll is AMAZING, even better than the scroll wheel on my OG MX revolution I love.-Good battery life.-Fast wireless connection, I did not try it with bluetoothNow for the Cons-The software is limited when it comes to button mapping.-The gesture button is basically not usable for me its hard to press.-The shape of the mouse would cause me to click when moving it around sometimes-Even though the description says its USB-C its not.  Just the physical connection to the mouse for charging is C.  The dongle that ships with it is normal USB A not C.  If you have a laptop with only Type C you will need an adapter or will have to use bluetooth.-My arm HURT just after the first hour using it.  I used it for a couple weeks and it did get better but not entirely.  My hand and forearm were sore from using this ERGONOMIC mouse, this is the main reason I returned it.The side scroll was basically useless as well.  Hard to use.  It needs some kind of ratcheting system or something.  I am sure there is some function it can be mapped to that would be amazing but it was too sensitive for me.-No Left/Right tilt buttons on scroll wheel.  I never realized how much I used them until I used this mouse without them.  It did have a single middle click but not the left/right tilt.When I initially googled product reviews on the Master 3s, all I got was stellar reviews.  After using it I googled more precisely and found many people that had very similar issues with the mouse when it comes to how uncomfortable it is to use.  for me I think it came down to the shape.  It forces your hand to angle into what it considered a more natural position but for me this was painful.  I did try elevating my wrist with a rest to try it out and it made it better but it is impractical for me to use my mouse this way long term.",2-Sep-22

218,DonH,5,1. It's economical2. It's a breeze to use3. It's fast &amp; accurate4. It's an excellent price to value mouse,31-Aug-22
219,JVB,5,"I bought the MX Master 3S because everyone and their brother heard my MX Master 3 for Mac make those annoying ""click"" sounds during Zoom calls. They weren't supposed to know I wasn't paying attention to them drone on. I had to take action. The mouse was killing my ability to surf the web/ do work/ play games, so I decided to spring for the MX Master 3s. The reviews online said, not worth the upgrade. Listen to me, if you are concerned about annoying ""click"" and it is a definite ""click,"" then buy this immediately. It's super quiet. The action is super nice, and all your friends will be amazed at your newfound ability to focus.  But you and I will know better, now won't we?",31-Aug-22
220,J. Mullis,3,On both my Mac and PC the mouse will randomly zoom in when scrolling.  Which is expected behavior if you're holding the command key on Mac.  But I'm not pressing any keys.  It happens a few times a day.  So not enough to warrant returning or getting a different mouse but still pretty annoying.  Searching around I see a few others have had this issue but no fixes.,31-Aug-22
221,Tiffany,2,"Worked great until it didn’t (right after refund window closed.) Now, no matter if it’s connected directly or just wirelessly, the lag is so horrible I switched back to my laptop’s mouse pad. I love the design and other features but it’s basically useless now.",30-Aug-22
222,Jerry Kurtin,3,"The mouse usually performs very well, and I love how easy it is to switch between devices, but it has a few sore spots that shouldn't be seen in this price range.1. the scrolling experience is terrible on a mac. The normal scroll mode scrolls about half a line, and the quick scroll mode always overshoots and looks very choppy in the animation2. the side scroll doesn't work on some applications (namely VSCode on PC). This has been a problem for a while based on online forums, but it still hasn't been resolved.",30-Aug-22
223,Amazon Customer,4,"My only issue with this mouse has come after two years of using it just about every day. I am now struggling to get my scroll bar to stay connected, the mouse will always work but have to turn it off and back on now to get my scroll to work. Other than that this is the best replacement to the mac trackpad that they have due to the multiple shortcuts allowed.",30-Aug-22
224,Alice,2,"If you are like me and are not allowed to install software on work computer I would advice against purchasing this mouse.  Most of the features are not available without the software. You cannot even change the scrolling option(smooth, clicky) without it or anything else. My mouse also had issues with connectivity. My mouse kept lagging even though I was maybe 2.5-3ft away from usb dongle. I did love the new ""quiet"" click.  If they fix the connectivity issues and include onboard memory I might try again. I will keep my G604, I find it more comfortable, has onboard memory and no connectivity issues.",29-Aug-22
225,Schudj25,5,"I guess you reach a certain age when you want tools that make work a little bit easier and more comfortable to facilitate. After seeing it recommended by Wirecutter I gave it a shot and they were right.Much easier to navigate and love the hidden features depending on the app (e.g., control music with thumb scroll).If you have the money, splurge and get this version than the more basic model.",29-Aug-22
226,M,3,The white mouse developed a yellow discoloration within a week of use ( I have clean Hands).  A search online revealed this to be a problem with other users.  The mouse itself works well,28-Aug-22
227,Amber J,5,"This is a great mouse and the silent click feature is very, very nice. Multiple shortcut features are fully customizable via the Logitech options+ app, which  adds a whole new level of functionality. Ergonomically, this mouse has a great feel and is comfortable during long periods of use. Ultimately, I would recommend this product to anyone.",28-Aug-22
228,Prometheus,5,"Love the mouse and how I can customize the buttons differently for individual applications. Felt that the mouse is definitely big (compared to other regular mouse), but now it feels comfortable since I have started using it for a while. Love that this has a horizontal scrolling as well.Was really reluctant to spend so much money for a mouse. Now that I have it, I felt that I should have bought it sooner.Next in the purchase list is Logitech Mx keyboard to compliment the mouse.",28-Aug-22

232,Derek Walters,5,"If you are on the fence about this mouse, just get it. I have been using a $35 logitech for over 10 years, and this is amazing. If you are interested in having software with customized gestures and buttons for each application, as well as a really comfortable professional mouse, this is for you.If you spend most of your day at your desk, like me, just get it already.",25-Aug-22

236,Willy Franklin,5,"I can't hear the mouse clicks... ...and it's weird... Also, the scroll wheel is super quiet... ...and that's weird too... It makes 0 noise when gliding on the mouse pad... It's like it's not even there, which is weird... But cool!!! I like it!",23-Aug-22
237,R. Suazo,5,"I’m a normal person that doesn’t do crazy stuff with computers. My job requires a ton of excel spreadsheets and various other things.  My old mouse had a delay and didn’t go sideways.  I have the M1 MacBook Air.  I bought an adapter to plug it straight into my computer, when I’m working from the coffee shop or when I’m home I use a hyperdrive 4k 10 in 1 to run another screen and plug in all the extras.  This mouse has quick reactions time and makes working from home a little easier.  I know some might call it over kill, but I love how comfortable the mouse is, how it goes from side to side and up and down flawlessly.  I highly suggest this for anyone that wants a mouse that makes life a bit easier!",23-Aug-22
238,B D,1,"I ended up returning the mouse. Mainly due to connectivity issues causing lag and stutter, but also because it's just a HUGE mouse. Why is the hump in the middle so great and the mouse so long? I am 6' and 220 pounds, I have pretty good size hands, and I found this a very awkward and big mouse. I think for it's design, it deserves a rest on the right side too for your palm. The way you hand sits on the mouse and the way they designed it, your palm really drags on that side. Anyways...Obviously, it's not a gaming mouse. I am NOT a competitive gamer and even I found it pretty awful during gaming - even on games like RDR2. It's just too slow and even if you download the logi software and increase dpi to 8k. Also, it's ANOTHER piece of logitech software. What are we up to now... 18? I have like 6 different logitech mice and each one has a different unifying software. Old ones, new ones... doesn't matter. The most recent of all of them, the unifier and software is different.I am assuming this is why a lot of people are having connectivity issues across the board with Logitech products? Because it's not just this mouse.On the positive side, I did love the build quality, the quiet clickers and the color options. I would absolutely enjoy this mouse if it had a palm rest on that right side because it tilts your hand to that side a little, it's necessary. I did not enjoy the scroller on this mouse, but I could have learned to live with it. I prefer the option of a physical click between infinite scroll and traditional. It's smoother and quicker. It felt like I was lifting weights trying to scroll a website with the MX 3S. Every scroll felt so heavy!My big question is ""why not both?"". Why not give us the good Lightspeed connection and same software that comes with those products with an expensive productivity mouse? Why not give us that ""gamer"" reliability in both connection and high DPI quality in a mouse designed the ""ergo"" way? Why can't we have it both ways? If you took this mouse and combined it with a G604 - you would have the perfect hybrid mouse ever:Tactile click, but silent.Great scrolling with the manual option for infinite scroll.A small amount of programmable buttons that are not intrusive or ""gamery"".An ergonomic designLightSpeed connection and software integration - also ability for a unifier to adopt a new peripheral.These are what we need to both be productive and have fun. Make us a hybrid please.",23-Aug-22
239,joey,5,"I absolutely love this mouse and everything about it. As a software engineer I spend a good majority of my day scrolling through a text editor and having that horizontal scroll wheel makes it easy to scroll left and right when lines get too long. Not to mention the scroll wheel can be bound to many other functions too such as switching tabs in your browser. Also the scrolls wheels have the most pleasurable resistance to them the normal scroll wheel is precise but smoothly transitions into free scroll and the thumb scroll wheel is meaty and has a lot of resistance which is great for the precise scrolling you generally do with it. The battery life is phenomenal I rarely plug in to charge. The ergonomics on this mouse are great as a quick disclaimer I'm a pretty large guy and have hands that are also large. And for me this thing just moulds into my hand as if it was an extension of my hand itself. I saw some reviews complaining about how the mouse didn't come with a little Logitech USB connection and that the Bluetooth connection was slow. But I am here to inform you that it does come with one of the little USB things and even if you lose it or something the Bluetooth connection isn't that bad. In conclusion if you are someone who uses a mouse all day this mouse is definitely worth it your hand won't get tired holding, you won't annoy coworkers with mouse clicks because they are completely silent and the extra functionality the buttons and scroll wheel provide are no brainers. 10/10",22-Aug-22
240,A. Ford,5,I like the size of the mouse and how it fits my hand. Works very well with my windows laptop.,22-Aug-22
241,Paul Feinberg,5,I do a lot of video editing and I love the side scroll wheel for timeline movement. I love all the custom buttons and that it works wirelessly Bluetooth with my Apple computer with no issues. Could never go back to a regular mouse now!,22-Aug-22
242,Omar Rodríguez,5,"This mouse is simply amazing! The customization is endless; you can customize each button (and even the scroll wheels) with app specific profiles, and it just works! No hiccups, no weird stuff happening; Logitech truly nailed it with this one!I paired it to a M1 Mac Studio via Bluetooth without any hassle, didn't need the dongle (included) to do so, and it works flawlessly. I ran into some issues while trying to install the Logi Options+ software at first, but it worked fine after a reinstall. The software is actually needed to unlock this mouse full potential, thankfully is very intuitive and simple to use, but if you're like me, and you like to use macros to speed up your workflow, this little mouse is pure gold. You literally can do anything you can think of with it.Regarding ergonomics, this is the most comfortable mouse I've ever used! A hundred million times better than the Apple's Magic Mouse for sure! Your hand, wrist and arm will thank you!As far as battery life, I can't say much because I still haven't had the need to charge it, but as far as I can tell, it surely lasts a long time.Although a little pricey, it's worth every single penny, and much more. All in all, I'm truly shocked at how awesome this mouse is. This is the best purchase I've made!",22-Aug-22
243,M. Sinan Akiman,5,"excellent mouse, customizable fully.. purchased along with mx mechanical to use one keyboard and mouse with two machines, one mac and one pc... and it works perfectly.",21-Aug-22
244,Amazon Customer,3,"Very nicely built office mouse, had to return it because I have large hands and it causes severe strains after using it for a while.",21-Aug-22
245,Teylor,4,so let me say i just received the MX master 3s as a birthday gift on 08/20/22: so far the device is great very ergonomic and feels great in the hand. the customization is great and the scroll wheel is as smooth as other reviews say it is. However when i first used the mouse it was having a lagging issue with my monitor which i found strange because on my 13in macbook pro it was fine. so after doing some research i discovered that the USB receiver loves USB 2.0 and not 3.0 and that seems to have mitigated the issue so far. hopefully i can update this later with a complete review but so far so good just that little hiccup,21-Aug-22
246,LunchBokth,1,"You will not be able to save button customizations for this mouse, which removes a lot of its functionality.  Apparently this has been an issue for a while.  Logitech has fallen.  This used to be a great mouse line.  look elsewhere.",20-Aug-22
247,Ryan,5,I’ve been searching for an awesome mouse that is also quiet as I work from home on the computer and often do zoom meeetings. I wanted the most comfortable mouse and most responsive on different surfaces as I usually go from room to room (or the bed or couch) with my laptop. Previous gen was glitching on different materials and the connection with the receiver didn’t often work. Also a priority was a quiet mouse (and I’m hoping for the worlds quietest keyboard to match one day) as the typing and clicking sounds get picked up in meetings. Doing telehealth I am frequently typing and clicking while talking to document and the quiet feature and responsiveness were the selling point. Please make a keyboard that is inaudible as well so my clients can have some peace and quiet,19-Aug-22
248,Amazon Customer,5,It took me a couple of days to get used to this but oh man it is a productivity powerhouse!!If you take the time to configure the different options and customizations it will be an absolute game changer for your workflow. I have wrist issues and this is a great mouse to prevent pain while being at the computer for 8+ hours a day.,19-Aug-22
249,Asia,5,"I did a lot of research before buying and I think this was well done.QuietSoftGreat colorNice buttons to configure using their app.Prior, I had the magic mouse by Apple. My hands and wrist were flat and I could never feel what was going on. I hate to say this, but that experience was terrible.I researched 10-15 other mouses and a lot of them did not have the ergonomics and button configuration. I also work in tech, so I made sure I was getting something that would fit me and not just what is popular.It looks esthetically pleasing to the eye. Of course you will see comments on here saying how much better it can be, but that's what any product. Make the decision and keep it pushing.For work I use Dell windows, for at home projects I use a macbook pro. I am able to use the mouse with both of them while working at the same time. My macbook has a USB-C, the dongle that comes with mouse fits in my Dell because it takes USB. The bluetooth works great.Don't over think too much. Just get what you need, learn, and make the choices you need for the future.",19-Aug-22
250,Steve,2,"Six months later, from a software developer...The mouse itself is great but many times the custom configuration doesn't work. So off you go to Logitech options where you have to try and re-discover the unifying receiver, and apply logitech options updates... Sometimes that fixes the issue but not usually, but all of that has been done. many times. Move the unifying receiver to another USB port, etc.You have to have Logitech Options to assign and execute the custom setup of your buttons. My center button is the Delete, which is very convenient for deleting lots of emails. But it rarely works.Logitech Options and the device driver detection is unreliable at best. I would not buy this again. I would not recommend this product.",19-Aug-22

Wrist hurts a lot less following long gaming sessions now too. I love all the extra buttons and functionalities available to be customized at my fingertips. The click wheel/smooth scroll for the scroll wheel is buttery smooth and satisfying a.f. to use. My wife loves it so much she wants me to get her one too even though she has a Razer gaming mouse already. Def worth the price tag.",17-Aug-22

Great feel, smooth scrolling, and I’m still getting used to all the programmable buttons, but they’re a great feature.I have had one occasion of losing the Bluetooth connection - might have been a Windows update installed overnight - but restarting the computer and reconnecting the mouse did the trick.I had used a wired MS Intellimouse for many years, and sm happy to have moved on to such a good product.

Logitech was able to fix the bluetooth lag issue that was present in the 2S which is great!The buttons are quieter but they feel ""mushy"" and I have a hard time pressing the thumb button sometimes. If you love the clicky and tactile buttons on the 2S then this mouse wont be as satisfying. Other than that this mouse is fantastic!",14-Aug-22
265,Torres Family,5,"I have used the previous model for &gt; 1 year (only purchased this model as I was taking the old one to work, ditching the wired non-ergo mouse there). I was expecting essentially the same mouse, but this is a significant upgrade - even MORE ergonomic and comfortable - and oddly more responsive and accurate if that helps for gamers. As someone who works long hours and long ago lost time for any joy, I cannot say how it does with games. BUT, for office (or home office) workers: if a cloud could be a mouse, this is it.  Putting in gulag hours and don’t want your wrist falling off? Look no further!",14-Aug-22

267,Amazon Customer,5,"I’ve had all the MX mice, they keep improving and this one is no exception.  This is incredibly comfortable to use all day, and the silent switches saved me from having to replace them myself.  Once you go to silent clicking there’s no going back.

The mouse is super responsive on Bluetooth or usb.,13-Aug-22
270,Shroomy,5,"Bought this for remote office work, and it's very comfortable and the silent click is very satisfying. Color isn't pure white but close enough to match my white/pink keyboard. Connectivity and battery life are both excellent. Hubby loves this MX Master so bought at least 5 from gen 2 to this 3S. Overall it's wonderful for hand of all sizes (I have small hand). He used it for light gaming before and said it's fine. More serious gaming it's recommended to use gaming mouse (latency, less tiring, and also smooth mouse navigation).

272,Travelin',5,"This mouse replaced a MS Sculpt Ergonomic mouse. While the Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard fits / works extremely well for me, the mouse goes from ergonomic and accurate to glichy and erratic. The worst is trying to file away emails, only to have a message drop into the wrong folder plus having a folder drop into another, requiring a bit of a search to find out where things went.The Logitech MX Master 3 has been in use for over a month now, and it is accurate and smooth. The fit is nice in my hands. The dongle is the third (others the keyboard and my headset) but it seems to ""play well"" with the others. Having multiple buttons and dials is overkill for me, but they can be easily customized to sit quiet.Overall, I would recommend this mouse for anyone needing a reliable, ergonomic, wireless mouse.",12-Aug-22

I can see a lot of dirt and other stuff from discoloring on the soft white surface.  See my included pictures to see the dirt/dis-colorization that I am talking about.There is not Options+ software on Linux.  So don't expect to change program buttons on this mouse even though Logitech calls this a ""Developer Mouse"".

<span> Really, pay attention.After being bombarded all over social media how awesome this mouse is, and having already the matching mechanical keyboard I decided to buy this mouse for my mac.Terrible decision, I have to admit. The mouse has a terrible polling rate, if it was a computer game I would say it runs at 20fps, just horrible; it seems to get fixed at times but then goes back to broken.And the scroll oh, you're getting nowhere with that. I tried to google an answer, but all I found was other people complaining about the same issue and Logitech support either washing their hands with a support articles that don't even apply to the software that is used with the mouse, or just saying they passed the feedback to their team.The issues do seem to be specific to mac, as I tested it on a Windows computer and it seems to be working fine, which I don't really get, as my windows only Razer deathadder V2 works amazingly well with no OS support whatsoeverIn short, if you bought this mouse and you have a mac, better go ahead and request a return label. I unfortunately can't, as I shipped it abroad.I find stupefying with how long this mouse has been out, that no solution has been presented for it, be it a software or firmware upgrade. Considering how its fine on windows, hardware it most certainly isn't.In the video attached this review can be appreciated how the Razer mouse scrolls (first one) vs the MX Master 3S.",10-Aug-22

283,Cliff Clavin,1,"Mac intel Catalina.latestThe vert and horiz scroll are in ""opposite"" directions, necessitating use of the options+ software to invert just ONE of the two. I believe the options+ software to be defective on Mac. I often get stuttering, glitchy tracking which through trial and error, I believe is the software. I have the mouse attached via USB2 port on my monitor, with the monitor (LG 27"" 4K) attached to the Mac via USB-C. If I go to bluetooth mode I have the same stuttering problems.It's occasional, but just enough to be unacceptable.My old MXMaster 2 never had this problem. I do love the hi dpi of the mxmaster 3, didn't realize I even ""needed"" this before, but the stuttering is a complete fail. I only sought to replace the mxmaster 2 because the mouse feet wore out and I you can't buy them OEM, only aftermarket and all of the available ones have a fair share of negative reviews.I bought 3 of these and I experience the problem with all 3. Each is on a slightly different computer setup in physically different places.It's too bad. This is the most ergonomic mouse I've found. I cannot go back to the mxmaster 2 now, so I'll have to find some other replacement.",9-Aug-22
284,Michael,5,"So far, I really like this mouse.  It replaced my M720 Triathlon that started having button issues.  It's my first rechargeable mouse, which makes me nervous, and I do wish the device button wasn't on the bottom side, like the Triathlon had on the side, which made it easier to switch between computers, but I do really like the mouse.  Unfortunately, one of the computers is a work computer, and I'm unable to install Flow on it.  I love the feel of it, and the automatic hyperscroll wheel is pretty awesome!  It's also my first mouse with a thumb wheel, which I also and finding extremely useful!",8-Aug-22

286,Leland White,5,"So I never thought I'd buy a $100 Bluetooth mouse, but I received several Amazon gift cards for graduation so I said what the heck. This thing is PERFECT for what I do. I use a 35"" curved monitor at home so the horizontal scrolling feature is very useful. The customizable buttons via the Logitech software are great too. I can appreciate the adjusted placement of the thumb button (in previous models it was not in a user-friendly location). I've only used it via BT and it connects quickly. Battery life is excellent.Overall, VERY satisfied, would recommend, and would definitely buy again!",8-Aug-22
287,big in japan,4,"Pros-Much improved ergonomics from the last gen.  Better scrolling experience too. New magnetic scroll wheel ratchet is a big improvement. Good connectivity with the dongle no noticeable latency. Haven’t tried the Bluetooth extensively with this mouse. Previous versions had a slight latency over Bluetooth.Nit picking-Optical sensor location is a bit too low for my liking. I would prefer the optical sensor to be essentially directly beneath, or in front of the scroll wheel for most precise curser tracking and control.The mouse still preforms does well with the current design but could be improved.The mouse left and right clicks are relatively  quiet, no complaints, though the tactility could be more crisp.Overall great mouse use it for 8+ hrs a day. Can potentially make your wrist sore where it contacts the table. A wrist rest or slidy wrist support is recommended for prolonged use.",8-Aug-22
288,Jimmy N,5,"I use this mouse for my home business and for general computing. It’s extremely comfortable to use. The shape is truly ergonomic, and it works perfectly on my glass top computer desk without a mouse pad. I am still learning how to program it to optimize it for different applications, but it works perfectly right out of the box. I really like that it has Bluetooth. It saves me a USB port when I use it for my laptop, which only has a few ports! I have a PC and a Mac and it works perfectly on either. The price is high but it's a worthwhile investment in my opinion. I highly recommend it.",7-Aug-22
289,Diego,2,"As the title says, this mouse is super comfortable to use. However, there are some weird issues with it. It was a pain to set up (Im using the M1 iMac) and when I used the Logitech Options+ software it thought I connected like 5 different mice, but eventually I got it to work after reinstalling the software. To avoid this issue, there's a series of specific steps to avoid duplicating the mouse in the software. Not a deal breaker, just a pain. For the more serious issue, the scroll wheel on this thing SUCKS. it feels extremely inconsistent, sometimes it scrolls fast or slow or super jittery and it makes a page go up and down when I'm scrolling in one direction. There is also this weird issue in Pages where the cursor ends up on random lines of the document that are not at all where I clicked. For $100, this should not be an issue. I hope Logitech sorts it out because this mouse feels great in the hand.",7-Aug-22
290,Reviewer MHM 3-5,2,"I have both the 3 and the 3S thanks to this most recent purchase.For perspective, I daily use the Razer Pro Click Mini, which replaced my Master 3 as my main pointer. Why? Both devices support multiple devices (Razer 4 to Logitech’s 3), and if you play around in Synapse enough, you can easily make the Pro Click do basically everything the MX Master can. Also, the Pro Click is much much faster. It has 1000hz polling to the Master 3’s 125hz. Latency is far lower as well.All in all the Razer provides everything the Logitech does and more and only sacrifices ergonomics.But ergonomics do matter, and I enjoyed the Master 3 prior to mouse and keys gaming / work from home. So I gave the 3S a shot. It was supposed to be better after all.Nope. Has all the benefits of its predecessors, as well as it’s drawbacks. The new silent switches are far worse than Razer’s; Logitech is all mush with no feedback whatsoever.My advice to you? If you use your pointer for only productivity and need multi device support, go for it. If you do any bit of gaming along with your work and need multi device support, spend the extra money and go Razer. I looked back for the 3S to find it didn’t add anything.",6-Aug-22
291,Random Ibis,5,"I got the MX Master 3S, White color, the looks is absolutely stunning I love it.Feel wise, its pretty comfortable for my small hands, it has a grippy texture which I like a lot. Side buttons are positioned in a easily reachable position, the soft thumb button that is by default bound to gestures feels awkward to press, needing to adjust grip to move thumb back and press on the the side of my thumb, or roll by thumb by like 45 degrees to press down.The silent buttons really are really quiet, but they feel a little mushy, you dont get much tactile feedback when its pressed, and if i relax my fingers too much sometimes the weight of finger presses the button without me noticing.",6-Aug-22
292,Jeff,1,This mouse has been used very lightly. It will no longer scroll without lock up. The MX keys also failed. Contacted Logitech and it took them a month to call me and tell me they could send me a new mouse but not the keyboard as it only has a 1 year warranty.  Stay away from this company!,5-Aug-22
293,MarkVLK,5,"My first ever mouse purchase was a laser mouse from Logitech in the early 2000s to replace the family ball mouse. I'm fairly certain my parents still use it to this day.<br>The point of me mentioning this is that, in my experience, Logitech products (particularly mice) have been durable and functional. Fast forward to 2020 when I was looking for an ergonomic mouse that would save my wrist from the pain of being on a computer all day nearly every day, for work and personal use. I also wanted the mouse to support macOS gestures since I'm a frequent user of them for work. I decided to purchase the Logitech MX Master 3 as it appeared to fit these requirements.I've now had this mouse for 2 years and I've traveled with it across the country working from different locations and setups. I've also accidentally dropped this mouse on the hardwood floor probably 20+ times over the last year (I'm getting used to a new under-desk slide-out keyboard/mouse tray where the mouse lays very close to the edge). Despite two years of all-day, every (work) day use and dozens of ~2 foot drops onto a hard surface, this mouse is still going just as strong today as it was 2 years ago.The metal scroll wheels (vertical + horizontal) are both very smooth and responsive. The button placement is comfortable (back, forward, left, right). The Bluetooth connection to my MacBook Pro works without any lag, and shows battery charge percentage in my Mac's menu bar. The gesture button (beneath the thumb) is comfortable and very functional - I have it set so that a simple click shows all my windows (mission control), holding it and moving the mouse slightly up reveals my desktop, and holding it and moving the mouse slightly down shows all my current app windows (app expose). All the buttons and sensitivity are easily adjusted via the Logi Options app. The battery lasts many weeks before needing a charge, and charges fast via USB-C.I highly recommend this mouse.</br>",5-Aug-22
294,M Ba,5,The mouse is amazing. One thing I’d fix is the scroller. It feels disconnected on the mac. Other than that love it.Love the multi device connections,5-Aug-22
295,Muddy,5,"1st: Don't plug this into a KVM switch. The device wasn't even recognized in XP this way. I'll just buy another USB Logi Bolt. Heh.2nd: My vintage Win98SE gaming computer is quite special. I had the huge serial Kensington Trackball plugged in. It's also running the ""Kernel Ex"" extensions for Win98SE. (Very good BTW) Lots of HW had been installed on it, and been unplugged over the years. I programmed chips from MicroChip too. So... Lots of drivers.What happened? How?Fascinating journey. :)Well, the driver for ""USB receiver"" appeared like XP (don't know where it got that from, possibly the old XBox 360 wireless game controllers driver ""XBCD"" -worked good), and... USB Rec. Kept appearing over and over...Uh oh. So I hit cancel, and noticed that the mouse was working in Win98SE!!!Rebooted. Froze. Uh oh.Booted in safe mode, on a lark, disabled the USB Receiver device (only 1 entry was there, huh).Rebooted. Now it seems to continue to run without it enabled.So I have the later Logitech Mouse Ware 9.79.025 (probably doesn't matter precisely)Trackball's still working fine.So- An interesting result!I'll keep this shiny new mouse!Got lucky I guess.On my Win10 5ablet, I had to install both Chrome and the LogiBolt WebApo because their native app wouldn't start. Maybe it's Win11or doesn't run on an Atom CPU???I had a 2nd LogiBolt I wanted to sync to my mouse's channel 2. You MUST run LogiBolt to do this. The CSR wanted me to return it. This would've been a complete waste of time.SSD Opinion:Keep backing up your computers, BTW, I went back to physical HDDs.I can't trust these SSDs. I've been through 6 of them now on both computers.So so fast. And so so sad.So... No. Not for me. Not anymore.I had the XP ones optimized.Just saying...It's pretty sad when a disc scan starts showing up the bad blocks everywhere...Usually a HDD will give you a chance to rescue things, but an SSD can just CEASE on you.",5-Aug-22

When my computer bag was stolen and my MX Master 3 went with it, this was the first thing that I had to replace.  I went two days using a traditional mouse and I hated every second.  I replaced the MX Master 3 with the 3S and while there are some very technical differences both mouses ultimately function the same.  The one difference that I can really tell is how much quieter the MX Master 3S is compared to the MX Master 3, I have had colleagues even comment on this feature.  If you work in excel the functionality of the mouse is phenomenal and a must in my opinion.  Logitec has done a fantastic job with the design and functionality and they have a fan for life.",3-Aug-22

For a long time I used my G502 for productivity (working heavily with Adobe CC), and decided to get more professional oriented peripherals. I use this mouse with my MX Mechanical Mini, and the ergonomics, software, battery life, and features are truly one of a kind.While I wasn’t initially a fan of the quieter clicks, I’ve grown quite the fan of it and combined with the scroll wheels and gesture button the mouse has a very premium feel. Battery life lasts a super long time and the graphite color perfectly matches my MX series keyboard. Never an issue with the mouse not connecting or disconnecting, and the wake feature is very quick as though it is on all the time.",2-Aug-22

Even with my ogre hands, the Master 3S is - true to its claim - silent.The USB-C Charge port is also a great bonus - Most of my other peripherals use a C cable and now I no longer have to keep a micro-USB plugged in to charge my mouse.If you enjoy previous iterations of the MX Master, you'll love the 3S!!",2-Aug-22

This mouse is the one. Response time is excellent, battery life is excellent, and connection options are excellent. It is built sturdy (a little heavy) and the feel is superb.It is very comfortable and my wrist pain is gone. The price of this mouse is a bit high but worth the investment in my opinion.My only issue is that the Logitech software does not let you change the thumb wheel to allow vertical scrolling. You either have to get key remapping software or change the remapping of the up and down of the wheel to ""up/down arrow"" or page up/down"" in the Logitech software. This makes scrolling awkward because the item has to be clicked into focus before scrolling.  If they add that option, this would be 5 stars.",1-Aug-22

Iwas using a wired macro (12 side buttons) before this and was worried Iwould lose some quick actions. I was able to customize across various apps through the Logi+ software to keep all the actions I needed but if you can't download the software to the machine you want to use this on, then I would not choose this mouse.My wife has yet to discover and use the gestures but she is not much of a productivity focused person working mostly from her phone doing sales.

Great mouse and very comfortable, too.With this latest one my daughter was having some issues and I told her to pull up the logitech unifying software to pair the mouse. It didn't work.It didn't work because the receiver is not a unifying receiver - it is a ""bolt"" receiver.These are apparently new and improved, but naturally they are not backwards compatible, so if I happen to have a keyboard compatible with a unifying receiver I'm back to having two USB receivers.I'm not against improvements, but having ""not compatible with unifying receiver"" suddenly inserted into the product description in very small print leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Three stars for that, even though I give the product five in general.",30-Jul-22
319,Abbey,5,I love this mouse. I tried the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort mouse but it was too flat and my wrists would ache after a while. Then I tried the rounder Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse. That was better but it still felt a little weird. It feels like you are holding a snowball because it is so round. I didn’t mind it and my wrists definitely felt less achy using the Microsoft Sculpt mouse compared to any other mice.Then I went to a local Staples store and tried out this mouse. The shape totally worked for me. My hand feels very comfortable and well supported. I also love the scroll feature that I can use with my thumb to scroll through Excel spreadsheets from left to right and vice versa. Any shortcuts that reduce the repetitive pointer finger clicking action helps my hand and wrist feel better and less strained.,30-Jul-22

So a warning for those who are trying to achieve a certain aesthetic that matches their desk.It seems it's common for discoloration to occur in lighter colors.I had no problems connecting the mouse to my computers and charging the mouse was lightning fast. I have average size hands so it fits comfortably for me.I wish this mouse was able to pair with other softwares so I can customize button actions. Otherwise I really like the horizontal scroll and find it handy.One thing to mention: I work a lot in design software and don't feel the horizontal scroll is all that helpful when panning or moving around artboards.Example: Mac Mouse I have an easy time scrolling across artboards by using the mouse to swipe, but I seem to lack this functionality with the MX and often have to use the space bar to move around artboards (not used to this at all). I have to utilize the grab tool more than I'd like and I actually find this kind of annoying and slows down my workflow until now I haven't figured out another method to scroll and pan easily across an artboard.",29-Jul-22

326,J,3,"I used it for a few days, and had to return it.  My (broken) G602 felt better in the hand, so I bought the G604 instead. The MX Master 3S  has its pros and cons.  For most people I think they will love it for its features -- best improvement is the forward and back buttons are better placed.  Most overrated or not as well done feature is the horizontal scroll wheel. It is placed too high for your thumb and it scrolls too fast.  But for me what I found most wrong with it was the bad overall shape..  and it led to something that was too much to justify keeping it  --&gt; a  #1 thing:  comfort.  Like anyone,  while keeping your first two fingers on the left and right buttons, we hold the mouse and move it with our thumb on the left and our third finger on the right.  The Problem:  My third finger was getting sore because it naturally rested where this mouse has a sharper edge, where it's rounded contour completely fades off and turns into a defined edge right where your third finger grabs it.  Logitech, you pay your design engineers way too much money to not think through these simple things..  Just keep the smooth rounded contour continuing the entire right side and full length of the mouse, it's that simple!  Also the same defined (not smooth) edge exists on the back of the mouse.  Why didn't you just continue the curve the rest of the way to the bottom or even and 1/8 from the bottom so the center of your lower palm has support too?  Why flare it so high where its sharper edge presses against the user's palm?  This can't save that much weight to have the mouse stop so high off the desk surface.  On my favorite of your mouse controllers of Logitech's, the G602, my hand rests lower and therefore naturally wants to touch more surface of the mouse, thereby better distributing the most weight of the user's hand.  With this MX 3S it's taller and rolls off steeply on all sides..  causing your hand to only be supported in the high point/middle where you lift your hand more to move the mouse, so you really lose even that support.  Result:  Very little support, resulting in more fatigue after several hours of use -- fatigue not only on the finger tip of the third finger that gets sore, as mentioned above, but also on the overall arching of the hand how it makes your wrist curve upward over the mouse instead of remaining straight/flat and forward like on the G602 and 604.  Don't build it so high and narrow and claim it's your best design.  Not when your other mouse controllers have done so well to avoid these problems.  I normally wouldn't write a complaint about such 1st-world problems, but again, you have design engineers that got paid a lot of money to do one thing..  make something comfortable.  It's not that hard to avoid these fit problems that were instantly noticeable.  Just trying to help you.",28-Jul-22

So you can close the active app, send a certain command to the terminal, run a macro/script in an adobe app, or run a build script in your favorite code editor.- I do usually run with the cord, but the it doesn't carry data, only power, but when I do go wireless, the battery lasts forever.",24-Jul-22

346,Joseph Bryant,5,"Review for: Logitech MX Master 3SI'll start by giving the Product name. I hate when users neglect to mention the product their reviewing because oftentimes it's some different product model than what I clicked on in the first place.That said, this mouse is a fantastic upgrade from the original MX Master. The only complaint I have and it's a biggie, is that this $100 mouse isn't compitable with the PS5. Are u kidding me ?! It's almost 2023 guys come on. Logitech has no excuse for this.I absolutely love the quiet key functionality. I've had to leave my older MX-1 at my desk a million times before because it's so loud in our staff meetings.Love the fact they've upgraded to quick charge USB - C ... I hear u can get 3H out of a 1m quick charge but I haven't put this through the wringer yet.Love the slimmer design. Love the ergo. I'm not too pleased with the positioning of the left thumb scroller tbh. Its situated differently than the first model and it seems a little inconvenient to access because I have to now lift my thumb to get to it. Almost have to look down everytime to access the darn thing.These are minor complaints - overall it's an exceptional mouse but seriously why would they change the position of the thumb scroller ?",22-Jul-22

350,Christina,2,"This mouse is advertised as having full Linux support, and it specifically mentions that it's made for coders or developers as well. This is misleading advertising and you should look elsewhere, because you can't unlock the full mouse functionality, such as the thumb gestures, without the Logitech drivers for this mouse, and the drivers are only available for Windows and Mac. There are forums posts full of people asking for Linux drivers that are over 3 years old, with canned responses from support and no activity from Logitech. 100 dollars for a mouse that you can't fully control without trying out various 3rd party softwares (and even then, the full set of functionaltiy is lacking) is far from worth it. Your money is better spent not supporting Logitech.",21-Jul-22
351,Larccc,1,"I am done with this thing. For the past year it's been intermittently losing connection and I've tried all the fixes I can possibly find online. Lately, I started just leaving it plugged in in hopes that the connectivity issues would resolve, but that hasn't done it either.It's to the point where I just have to toss this in a garbage/back-up pile. Had to pull out an old wired unit just to restart my PC and write this review.I don't know if it's Logitech. I don't know if it's Bluetooth. But whatever it is, it interrupts my work too often. This was a waste of money but did help me learn that I'm going back to a USB wired connection and avoiding using Bluetooth for this kind of peripheral.I know it's got great reviews on here. I know all the YouTube influencers rate it highly. Because that's why I bought it. What a steaming pile of horse manure. The periodic connectivity issues interrupt my work and it's just unacceptable. This like mice and keyboards should get out of the way and let users get things done. But this garbage does the opposite. If you want an annoying high-maintenance device barking at you and blocking your flow, get this hot garbage. Okay, flame over. You've been warned.",20-Jul-22

360,Christopher Wilson,3,"I REALLY wanted to love this mouse.  However, on a Mac, the scrolling on the MX Master 3S is jittery, even with ""Smooth Scrolling"" turned on.  I ended up returning the mouse because I could never get the scrolling as smooth as the Apple Magic Trackpad or Magic Mouse.  If you're used to smooth scrolling on a Mac, you'll be disappointed with the scrolling on this mouse.  In addition, I have large hands, and I found the Gesture button and back/forward buttons to be a bit awkward to use.  Finally, I wish there was an option for a USB-C receiver instead of the included USB-A one.",17-Jul-22
361,Unhappy,1,I've had 3 Logitech mice over the years and each has failed due to poor scroll wheel. It works fine for a while but becomes non responsive. The current MX Master 3 is also uncomfortable to use after an extended period of time.,17-Jul-22

365,K. C.,5,I just bought this mouse. I used it as is and didn't look for program updates. You must download the app/program To be able to customize and use to full potential. The mouse can be customized to specific programs . For example different buttons for micrsoft word vs internet explorer. You can use it while charging and while connected to the computer.  I use the bolt USB to connect it when I was customizing the mouse on the logitech program .  This is the first mouse i have bought with many functions. For 100$ I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep it but I will. I am enjoying it.,17-Jul-22
366,Karly ,3,"I liked the mouse, it is very handy when you're working on multiple devices.My main complaint is the scroll wheel, it broke in less than a month. It kind of works, but it no longer 'provides feedback' while scrolling, it does not fixes its position. It now also has a lag, so the scrolling stops later than I actually stop using the wheel.",17-Jul-22

The battery life is also great.I also like to play games and I prefer to switch to a different mouse for gaming. This mouse feels a little heavy and clunky for the games I'm playing but it would be fine for a casual gamer.The clicks are soft but satisfying.The bottom button is a little hard to hit for smaller hands like mine but it's doable.Overall I like using this as a daily driver but I switch to a more gaming styled mouse when gaming at night.,13-Jul-22
378,Daz,1,"The mouse if good, but the means to connect it to your laptop is either a bulky USB-C to USB-A converter or using standard Bluetooth. This does not set a good example for a brand new product that does not support most laptop connectivity for 5 years. The USB-C standard was created back in 2014, most Apple and Windows devices support USB-C and many exclusively, not only to support the latest features and capabilities but also to reduce form factor where USB-A is too bulky.Logi have multiple requests from users on their website to support USB-C for over 5 years. The only response is, we will raise it with our product team. They have now launched another new top of the line mouse MX Master 3S which has USB-C for charging (and boy that took a long time), but the receiver that plugs into your laptop is still only USB-A!!! ??The European Union has mandated that manufacturers support USB-C by 2024. You know you have missed the plot when legislation is ahead of product development.So if you are buying this mouse for the latest features and capabilities, make sure you are ok with adapter cables or plugs hanging out of your laptop. You might find it easier to just buy the MX Master 2S that's now cheaper..... or look for another manufacturer that does innovate and supports USB-C receivers for connectivity to your device. Even if your current computer still has USB-A, your next one may (probably will) not.",12-Jul-22

It's really ruined what could have been a great long term mouse.  Also, it's a bit on the large side and I have large hands and it still feels like it's too tall.  Another thing I'd wish they would change is to relocate the bluetooth switch somewhere on the top so it's easier to switch devices without using the stupid software.  Lastly, the mouse does not have usb connectivity which is required on some company computers due to security.  One more thing, it's time to put better skates/slides on this series of mouse, teflon is for cheap mice.",10-Jul-22
383,Abel Gancsos,2,"As a Logitech user that has every revision of the MX Master series mice, currently using the 3(non-S) because it offers gesture features without the software (which is buggy anyway), I'm not happy with this revision.  The gesture button for me is critical for full productivity.  So I had high hopes for the 3-S, but 5 minutes of testing came full disappointment.  Gesture features now explicitly require the software and brings us back to legacy productivity.  The only part I liked was the silent click, but at the cost of loss of productivity?  When designing products, keep in mind that software to enable features is often times not an option, this is a break in backwards compatibility.",9-Jul-22

Compared to my Razer Viper Ultimate, poling rate is significantly lower and it’s bigger mouse so it took me a while to get used to it, but after couple months of usage some parts of the mouse started to “yellow” get “brown” or just discolor. My keyboard has white caps and headphones are white also, but none have changed the color, so I cannot blame anything but Logitech’s poor choice of materials. It’s overall a nice mice to use but do not buy for gaming even on the side or just pick black. Unfortunately I cannot return this one. For 100$ mouse, this was a poor choice on my side.",7-Jul-22

I LOVE the fact that it's rechargeable...and yes the charge seems to last for quite awhile, but I'd rather keep it topped-off than run it down too much. It's certainly the largest mouse I've ever owned...but unquestionably also the most ergonomic. I haven't mapped-out all the button assignments yet as I haven't decided what I really need in that regard yet. But I really like the mouse. I will say that at times, it can be too easy to do a left or right mouse click unwantedly, so I'm still getting used to it....and because I haven't grown-in to it yet, and the mouse is $100, I've giving 4 instead of five stars.

The scrolling is excellent when it works and when it doesn't work it still gets the job done to some extent. also the swipe gestures are also easily done on this mouse. and anything you want to do can be hot keyed to the mouse as well.<br><br>5/5 would 100% recommend even with dodgy scrolling.</br></br>,3-Jul-22

402,Daniel Whitaker,1,"Where do I begin? This is undoubtedly the worst consumer gadget I've ever used. I'm a seasoned PC enthusiast, I built my own PC, I make 3D motion graphics professionally, and a mouse is very important to me. I'd say the biggest flaw with this mouse is its software. You can program different buttons to do different things, which is nice in theory, but the software bugs out every single time I use the mouse, and what WAS the ""back"" button then became an ""undo"" button. For instance, I was navigating my file manager, pressing what I thought was the ""back"" button (the little button just above my thumb), but the software was registering that button click as an ""undo"" button the entire time. I had previously moved files around, copied, and deleted, certain files... well, without me even realizing, I was undoing all of that. I can't even really process what just happened because, to be frank, I've never ever experienced such a colossal failure from a gadget - not only does this mouse not do what it's supposed to do, it actively deletes your files. Do not buy. Do not waste your time. It's the worst gadget on Earth.",29-Jun-22
403,RJ,1,Bought this because of all the scrolling features it has. But scrolling is broken on some important Chrome webpages. It just stops and won't scroll again until a click happens somewhere on the page. The software for this needs an update. Other than that one important thing I need to work right it's a great mouse.Also needs a coast adjustment setting for smooth scrolling. It coasts way too far. Am chasing links with my pointer as they scroll up my screen for 4 seconds after I stop rolling the wheel.,29-Jun-22

After I've bought my first Macbook Pro, I decided to get the Magic Mouse and while it worked well with the Macbook, it doesn't feel as substantial to hold as the Logitech MX Master 2. Granted, the Magic Mouse was meant more of a touch surface device. You also can't customize the Magic mouse like you can with Logitech. Therefore I've decided to get this MX Master 3s. And it's great. Works right out of the box and now I'm able to have customized buttons to make work more efficient. I do a lot of copy of pasting and being able to do that with a click of a button is great. You can also customize the side scroll wheel to jump between browser tabs.

422,Steven Terry,3,"I was really hoping to be able to use this mouse. It is beautiful, and the silent clicks feel amazing. However, how things are configured on the mouse makes it very painful for me to use.

423,Kevin,5,This mouse is amazingly smooth to use and quiet buttons.,22-Jun-22
424,Sobe,3,"Pros:1.) The fact that the scroll wheel is all metal or at least gets rid of the stepped plastic insert from the 2S.Cleaning that part of the mouse was a minor quibble on the 2S nonetheless. Either way, the all metal scroll wheel feels a lot better to use now that it's all metal and the actual groves in the wheel feel much better to touch.2.) The silent clicks on the right and left clicker are a positive in my mind.3.) USB-C is a plus.Charging is faster although I didn't bother to time the exact difference between the 3S and my 2S. Future-proofing is a good thing given that the future is USB-C4.) Bigger horizontal scroll wheel with a caveat though (see con#1).No plastic grippy insert for the the horizonal scroll wheel on the 3S which is a pro or a con depending on how you use the horizonal scroll wheel. I didn't mind it either way on the 2S and not having it on the 3S is the same for me.Cons:1.) Logitech moved the dedicated side buttons lower and placed the horizontal scroll wheel above the dedicated side buttons.That means my thumb is constantly touching the lower of the two buttons on the left side which is not my preference. Compared to the MX Master 2S, the 3S two side buttons are too close to my thumb now which means I accidentally click the (default) forward button on the 3S more than I ever have when I used the MX Master 2S.2.) The rubber or soft-touch plastic that surrounds where your palm goes is way too slippery for my taste.The MS Master 2S had a grippy soft outer rubber layer for the thumb and the palm which made it much easier to hold and grip. Unfortunately the MX Master 3S is very slippery and harder to grip. The MX Master 3S is definitely much easier to clean but holding the mouse requires me to use my pinky and right ring finger more often. Compared to when I used my Master MX 3S, I could easily and swiftly wander with the 3S using only my pinky and thumb to hold the right and left sides respectively.3.) Activation/press area of hidden thumb button is much smaller on the 3S compared to the larger area on the 2S.There's a little grove/pit that you press down on using your thumb with the 3S and it's much smaller than I would like. Not only is it smaller on the 3S, the position of the area/grove is too far behind where my thumb rests. I have to scrunch up my thumb to reach back on the mouse to click it which is annoying. The 2S had a much better placement and the entire area your thumb rest on was clickable. Yes, the 2S had that hard plastic edge that made it harder to clean and allowed things to get into which made it even harder to clean but since I always have clean hands it was never an issue for me with I used the 2S hidden thumb button.4.) The 3S has a smaller palm area.Depending on your preference, this is a con or a pro or both. For me, this is a con. I have small hands so I liked how much more bulkier the MX Master 2S was. The bulkier 2S was easier for me to hold because I didn't have to scrunch up my palm in order to make more contact with the palm rest. This also means less area for your palm to rest on which I do. If you don't rest your palm on the mouse as much, this won't be a con for you.Not a pro but not a con either:1.) No storage area for the Bolt receiver on the 3S anywhere just like the 2S unfortunately.I don't travel a lot so it's not a problem at the moment but I would have still liked to see a tiny compartment to place the Bolt receiver into when not in use. One of my old Logitech wireless mouse had a removable battery compartment which allowed you to place the receiver into when it wasn't in use and that was great. Now I can and have lost a few receivers because there's no place to put those tiny Unifying receivers.2.) No visible charge level indicator.Yes there is a charging indicator but it doesn't tell you the battery level/percentage without having to check the software. The green light is simply on of off. I don't know what it looks like when there is a low battery (like if it turns red or anything) but I'd rather know the actual percentage just from glancing at the mouse instead of having to open up the software and constantly check. For example, three tiny lights to tell me if the battery is high, medium, or low. Notifying me only when it IS low on battery is literally waiting until the last minute to let me know before I have to charge it which isn't a plus exactly.3.) Ambidextrous it is not.I'm not left handed or ambidextrous but I really would have liked to have seen an ambidextrous version of the MX Master series from Logitech.4.) You can use it even when it's charging (looking at you Apple and Sony).I hate not being able to use my devices when they're charging especially because I don't like to plus in my devices to let them charge (and then overcharge) overnight. I'm glad Logitech didn't try to reinvent the wheel just to look sleeker and dumber like Apple's pathetic (not so) Magic mouse.5.) No USB-C receiver.I switch between a desktop using Windows and a MacBook Air. The Windows desktop uses the Bolt receiver and the MacBook Air uses Bluetooth. The Bluetooth use for this 3S mouse is a little laggy on my MacBook Air but I don't mind it much since I code as a hobby. My Windows desktop is my main computer. I don't have a Bolt receiver for my MacBook Air yet but that's because I'm a.) waiting to see if Logitech gives us a Bolt receiver with USB-C and b.) I don't have a docking station/hub yet to use with my MacBook Air anyway (and the MacBook Air I have only has USB-C ports). The reason why this isn't a con or a pro is because my Windows desktop doesn't have any USB-C ports to begin with because of COVID and the chip shortage with those eye-watering prices for computer components. Otherwise I would have built a new desktop computer by now.I don't know if Logitech even reads these reviews but I really hope the next iteration isn't worse. It's becoming increasingly more difficult to find tech you like to use only to not be able to find a replacement down the road because the series was discontinued or has been ""upgraded"" by a manufacturer. Either way though, I'm glad we have the 3S. I can certainly imagine a much worse product/world if we didn't have the 3S. Things could have been worse with the 3S but thankfully they're not world-changing bad at least for me.",21-Jun-22
425,Zach Gutierrez,1,Product suddenly quits working for many people. Doesn't show in Amazon reviews but you can find it on Reddit. It just happened to me after only about a year of use.,21-Jun-22
426,Steven O. Jeffries,3,This mouse is well made and feels good in my hand.  It tracks well and all that.  My issue is switching from one computer to the other.  The buttons to do that were positioned one the side right under my thumb on my 720 making it very easy to switch form one computer to another.  On this mouse those buttons are on the bottom.  I have to lift the mouse up off the desk to operate those buttons.  I was excited that I was going to be able to eliminate mouse from my crowded desk but no go.  It's too much trouble to lift the mouse up every time I want to change to the other computer.  Other than that (which is significant to me) it's a fine mouse.  I may go back to the 720 just so I can have those buttons on top.,21-Jun-22
427,Bart Hubbard,5,"I've sat in front a computer in my career for more than 25 years and this is the best mouse I've ever used. It's comfortable and ergonomic, so my hand isn't sore or tired at the end of the day. The buttons click quietly, but in a satisfying way. It lasts for weeks between charging, and the charge port is such that I can use it while it's charging.The best part, by far? The scroll wheel. It has the usual Logitech feature of a small button to unlock the wheel to free-spin, but even better - if you spin the wheel hard, it auto-unlocks and spins quickly and then re-locks when you stop it. I can fly to the bottom of a scrollbar so easily I don't know how I lived without this feature.I'm not a serious gamer so I can't speak to that, but I've played a couple of old FPS games and it seemed to work great.I'm using this on a M1 Mac Mini via bluetooth and the performance is excellent. I've heard that you can also setup the dongle to possibly get better performance, but in my testing it was no better.",21-Jun-22
428,Andy,5,"Six months ago, I finally upgrade from a cheap wired mouse to an MX Master 3 for work, and it was a game changer. Never realized how much difference a good mouse makes.I'd been considering getting one for personal home use for a couple weeks when this new 3S was announced, so I went ahead and ordered it.The only noticeable difference between the 3 and the 3S is the clock sound. The 3 has a traditional loud click. The 3S sounds muffled and almost silent. For the first few days it bugged me, but I got used to it, and then quickly grew to love it. Now, the loud clicks on the 3 sounds overly loud to me.This is an awesome mouse. Expensive, yes, but you get what you pay for.",21-Jun-22
429,Elevation Lab,5,Very ergonomic,20-Jun-22
430,Justin Hairston,4,I love the color and the ergonomic feel of the MX Master 3S its quiet and responsive the one main downside to owning this mouse after less than a week of owning is that its already showing signs of discoloration on the top and on the side I happened to get a ink stain that is impossible to clean. Overall this is a great mouse. I'll end up buying the black version of this mouse too just so I dont have to worry about stains and smudges  .,20-Jun-22
431,Charles Wiest,5,This mouse is awesome!  I love that it connects via Bluetooth so I don't have to waste a USB port.  The ergonomics are great - it fits my hand well and it is very responsive. The rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  It's worth the price!,20-Jun-22
432,Aaron S,5,"This is an excellent mouse.  Keypress is smooth and accurate.  The scroll wheel is extra smooth and quiet.  Scrolling and pointing with this mouse is very smooth and I have had no issues.  I do like how the software has the option to customize buttons by application, that's a plus.  The thumb wheel is great and works smoothly.  Battery life is excellent and lasts me over a week and I am using the backlight and am working ten hours a day.<br>One thing I do not like is the mouse's forward and back buttons!  How could Logitech get this wrong?  I did not have any problem with my corded Logitech mouse, but with this mouse the forward and back buttons are not positioned well at all.  They are too far back toward my wrist to comfortably press with the pad of my thumb, and I have to contort my thumb is an uncomfortable way in order to press the buttons!  Not good.  The texture and build of the buttons are also not good, just doesn't feel right.Overall, this is a great product and I do recommend it in spite of the few flaws I mentioned.</br>",20-Jun-22
433,Zach,5,This mouse feels good and is very multifunctional!,19-Jun-22
434,Katya,4,"I love this mouse!The clicks are dead silent and feel good (in my opinion)The software is impressive.My only issues with it are: - The scroll wheel is a bit heavy in ratchet mode, and the free-scroll is a bit too much. I like the Logitech Lift scroll wheel much more- The horizontal scroll wheel is a little awkward to use and I have accidentally triggered it a couple times (but maybe these issues will go away with extended use).I haven't used any other Logitech MX mice, but I have used plenty of Razer mice and Anker's vertical mice.I love the shape and feel of this mouse, but for my use case, I will likely stick with the Logitech Lift.The Lift isn't as feature rich, but for a mouse, I don't need the horizontal scroll wheel or the extra button on the base.Very impressive mouse and I would recommend it to anyone who wants something more ergonomic but doesn't want to go full vertical!",18-Jun-22
435,J.C.,5,"The only major gripe I have is that the ""Gestures"" button on the wing is somewhat useless if you play any games (you'll have to disable it). Besides that, this is a great mouse for 4K displays, gaming, production, browsing, et cetera.The battery life is great, the USB-C charging is fast, and when it is charging, it just turns into a normal wired mouse (unlike Apple's horrendous Tortoise Baking in the Sun design).The newer revision (the MX3S) is mostly the same, only the DPI sensor is meant for 8K. I haven't had any issues with this to push me towards the ""upgrade"" and I doubt many people out there have 8K displays, yet.Definitely consider this mouse if you spend lots of time at a computer.",18-Jun-22

The optional free spinning scrolling wheel is perfected really well on this one including on Web pages which in the past with earlier versions could be a problem. It can have a little delay when first moved after sitting idle for a bit. That doesn't cause me any problems for non gaming applications. I've never tried to game with it. I doubt that would be a good functional fit for it, at least where timing is critical.",17-Jun-22
439,powerful_smr,1,Do not buy this mouse.Every day I have owned this mouse I have had issues with the mouse interfering with my Logitech keyboard. I am sure it is a setting that I both do not appreciate and do not need which is causing this issue.

448,Alex Pak,5,"Before purchasing the MX Master 3S, I used the MX Master 3 since 2020 and have loved that mouse. Super ergonomic and comfortable to use all day.What really sold me on this new mouse was the fact that the clicks are near silent.Upon receiving this, it feels exactly the same as the MX Master 3, but oh man is that silent click nice. They were able to remove the noise all while maintaining the tactile feedback you get from the standard MX Master 3.Now, I don't think it's worth upgrading from the MX Master 3 if you already have it unless you really like the idea of a silent click - which is why I upgraded. Both are phenomenal devices and you can't go wrong with either.Highly recommend giving this a go!",13-Jun-22
449,calif law prof,5,Logitech makes terrific products. And I have been buying them for years. My last mouse lasted so many years that I almost didn't upgrade to this new one. Now I wish I bought this immediately when it came out. It is soooooo smooth and easy to use. And I have a dark desk pad and no mousing surface. This mouse works anywhere. Has easy to use features (and I am over 50 years old). And it is virtually silent. I work at home -- all day and all night -- and this mouse is terrific and virtually silent. Well worth the price.,13-Jun-22
450,Jordan,5,"I tried a g502 for work and it just didnt feel right, this mouse however is really comfortable and has nice quiet kind of tactile feel if you are into keyboards without the click. I stay up pretty late and click a lot so this helps with the noise. The mouse isnt really for gaming and it weighs around 140g so its pretty heavy. No connection issues when using dongle, and a very slight but not noticeable on bluetooth.",13-Jun-22
451,Tom,5,"My low end corded mouse has been bugging me for years. This mouse works on a pad with a dark cat photo, my old grained wooden desk, and even on a white paper towel. It's very responsive with more features than I really need, not being a gamer.",12-Jun-22
452,Greg,5,"I’m usually set in my old way and don’t like having to adjust to new things, like a mouse. This mouse is perfect. Long lasting charge, fast charging, easy and comfortable to use with a couple of extra nice features. Definitely recommend.",12-Jun-22

454,withlovelara,5,I use 3 different laptops and got so tired of having to keep up with 3 different mice.  I can  use this one mouse on all three with the click of one button on the bottom of the mouse.The lateral scroll and function button under the thumb are gold.  Now I can cut/paste without removing my hand from the mouse.Cheap?  Nope.  Worth every penny?  Yep.,11-Jun-22

458,Tech49,5,"I'm a big fan of Logitech's MX line because it's all the peripheral with none of the gaming attitude sprinkled on (RGB lighting, weird shapes/colors, etc.) The MX Master 3S seemed like the perfect companion to my new MX Mechanical Mini keyboard (which I really like). I like that they use Bolt (faster and more secure) and wanted to get rid of my MX 3's unifying receiver. I also like seeing the battery percentage in Logi Options+ which is unique to this latest generation of products.Before I even got it, there was one thing that I held against the new mouse: It thought I was going to hate the new ""quiet"" clicking sound of the Master 3S. I thought that it would interfere with the tactile feel of using it and make things boring. I was wrong.Once you have to pull an all nighter because some release/project/deadline is approaching and you have to make sure everything gets submitted/processed/merged, you will appreciate that you will not have to endure the menacing high-pitched clicking of your mouse as you move about your computer's GUI at 3:30AM.The very satisfying ""thock""s you get from the mechanical keyboard combined with the quiet yet satisfying clicking of the new mouse, and you get a setup that is not offensive in any environment; from the home office all nighter to the day-to-day office use, the latest gen Logi MX line is all focused on zen and getting you into the proper ""work"" headspace.",10-Jun-22
459,Abhinav Gupta,5,"Very function mouse. Love all the functions.  Installs very easy, top and the side scroll wheels are very useful for spreadsheeting, still trying to get used to other buttons.  Also like that you can setup on multiple devices.  Helps a great deal.  It does not fit as well in my hand, it is a bit big- I would have liked it to be bit smaller, making it easier to handle and also travel with.  Some reviewers had issues with it being sluggish while gaming, I had no issues, not that I am avid gamer.  Overall works well and am happy with the purchase.  Recommend trying out.",8-Jun-22

461,Matt W.,5,"I was weary on spending $100 on a mouse, but this mouse has lived up to the hype. I paired this with the Logitech MX Keys and they both use the single universal receiver.  Mouse scrolling is great and the number of buttons is adequate for daily use and gaming. Ergonomics are excellent...very comfortable to use.Bonus: As a developer and engineer I use multiple systems during the day and the ability to switch between systems without a clunky KVM and all the cables is HUGE.  You can switch between 3 different systems so long as you have 3 universal receivers (which are cheap to buy).Bottomline: Worth the money.

467,Anil N.,5,"So, I got this to replace my MX Master 3, since it was way past the warn out state.  At first, I didn't have any issues with it, the 3s, and it was so smooth.  What I really liked about it, was that the clicking on both of the buttons were soooo quite.  Then this morning, I started to have stuttering/lag issues to no end.  Updated firmware, drivers, ran it with the usb dongle for wireless use, swapped to usb 2.0 port, switched to bluetooth connectivity, and all of that just didn't work.  I'm running a windows 11 pro pc.  I've tried every imaginable fix, and nothing is working.  I just wish Logitech could have come up with a solution to this horrible issue.  I just picked up a Razr Viper Ultimate, which was only $10 bucks more.  Hopefully, my day will be a whole lot less frustrating when I start using that mouse.  I still plan on keeping the Logitech, since eventually, hopefully, they will fix this issue.",6-Jun-22

I could be wrong though, but I have had no issues so far with the ""PC/MAC"" version of this mouse on my M1 Mac.- I am using it on an M1 iMac which has all USB-C/Thunderbolt, so a little USB-C - USB3 adapter works great for the dongle if you prefer that over bluetooth. They are very cheap (I bought the Syntech one since it has no cables).- I would assume that compared to the Magic Mouse you lose some gestures, but I only really used the scrolling anyway outside of the normal clicking.

480,The Chief,1,"First off, I have a MX Master 3 with a unifying receiver and it is an amazing mouse.  I also have MX Keys and love how they work together.  The only thing that ever annoyed me about the MX 3 is how loud the click is.So, I decided to ""upgrade"" to the 3s due to the quiet click and higher DPI.  Now the only thing I like is the soft click.  Here is a list of problems I had:--Does NOT work with original Logitech Options software, AT ALL!  You HAVE to use Options+.  My work computer does not allow me to install Options+ because Logitech is stupid and only released an online installer for it.--Could not get my MX Master 3 to unpair from my logitech account, so I had to uninstall and reinstall Options without loggin in to my logitech account.  Even then, Options could not see the 3s at all.--The Bolt dongle is extremely buggy and no better than Unifying.  It was obviously not ready for release.  Logitech dropped the ball on this.  I actually prefer Unifying due to the advanced pairing mode that is available.  Makes things so much easier.  Every time Logitech attempts to make something user friendly, they mess it up.  Give us some more advanced features.Needless to say, returning this junk.  Do not buy if you want a fully functional mouse.",1-Jun-22

486,Pentachoron,5,"I bought this mouse in an instant when I saw it had quiet clicks for the primary and secondary buttons. I can confirm after a marathon of copy and pasting in spreadsheets that the clicks are acurate and very quiet. I have another mouse that is made for gaming, and its buttons are satisfyingly loud and clicky, but can get annoying after a while without headphones to damp the sound. This Logitech mouse is satisfyingly subtle. The magnetic scroll wheel is super smooth and accurate too. Thank you for making a quiet and acurate tool Logitech!",26-May-22
487,Dave K.,5,I have a need to control 3 laptops at once. This device intuitively handles jumping from one to another and doesn't skip a beat. I love the enhance features it has and when couple with MX Keys keyboard what a dynamic duo!,26-May-22
488,Brian G,4,The button to change between devices being on the bottom was a deal breaker for me.  The M720 proved to be a more practical option if using the mouse to switch between displays frequently. Otherwise an impressive mouse,26-May-22
489,Dschettlr,5,"I decided to get an MX Master for my home gaming setup after using one for months at work. I absolutely love this mouse at work as it extremely comfortable and nice to use. I leave a shift of 8 hours of computer work with no wrist fatigue that one could experience with an OEM style mouse. That being said, the mouse is very heavy for any kind of fps gaming or anything where you need to be making quick movements. After an hour or so, my wrist was getting very tired and I ended up returning this to get a much lighter Mouse. If you are doing almost entirely productivity tasks, this is a must have. If you are mostly gaming, I would buy something lighter like a G502 or a Razer.",26-May-22

491,richard garcia,3,This mouse is amazing. The customizable features that logitech put into this is very helpful for Excel and Blue Beam. I gave only 3 stars because I have not had it over 2 months and it has begun drifting. It scrolls down very slowly but it is irritating when I am reviewing documents. For the price I did not expect to have any issues. I hope that no one else encounters this problem. Mine may just be defective.,23-May-22
492,Steve Cataldo,2,"I liked being able to program the buttons specifically for different programs, but the software is way too glitchy.  And I'm always running Logitech and updating it whenever anything is available.<br>I have the thumb scroll wheel (on the side) set to scroll in Excel, then randomly it will invert directions.  Or it won't work at all.  Or suddenly it started changing what was on my screen.  And once it just started changing the computer volume up and down.  All while I was still in Excel.  I have to click to another file, or exit my file and reopen, or plug in the mouse, or unplug it all to try to get it to work again.  And this is the same on both of this same mouse that I purchased.I also have issues with the normal vertical scroll wheel where the wheel loves to scroll down (sometimes I move my finger a little and it decides to just keep going for an extra 5 seconds even when I try to stop it or scroll up.  In Excel I can scroll down a thousand rows in a few seconds, but I feel like it takes 20 minutes to scroll back up using the wheel.  In some programs it will suddenly zoom in/out 100x because of the scroll.So if you can deal with it being glitchy, when it works it's a pretty good mouse with some cool functions.</br>",20-May-22

The fact that I can connect to 3 different devices is great! The battery longevity is awesome, I use it at work for 8 to 10 hours a day and at home for about 4 to 6 hours a day. I can say that they both last about a month to a month and a half. The Logitech software lets you customize the buttons, even per application. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a productivity mouse.",17-May-22
499,Arman Alimian,3,"Overall a good/promising device; however, neither Options nor Options+ allowed me to change the side scroll-wheel to do vertical scrolling instead of horizontal. I wanted to do this since the device felt bulky, so I customized the middle button to act as if I'm pressing the scroll-wheel button, but then I wanted to fully abandon using the vertical scroll-wheel and the side one instead and I couldn't.Also have experienced some connectivity issues with Bluetooth. The mouse pointer would disappear sometimes. But connecting through the unifying receiver seems to solving the issue. Overall I have ended up buying 3 different Logitech mice over the course of past month or so, which is this one, the MX Anywhere and Lift and this one is the best.",16-May-22

It’s a good size for most hands and is angled to take pressure off your wrist. I sit at a computer for work for 8-12 hr/day 5-6 days a week and it’s done wonders for the fatigue/pain I was seeing in my wrist. A little pricey and there’s probably cheaper options that are just as good for the average computer user but if you work in an office and spend more time than not in front of a computer it’s well worth it in my opinion",15-May-22

518,David Doria,3,"The tall form factor caused my wrist to bend back a bit more than with my previous mouse.  It wasn't much, but it proved to be enough that my wrist started feeling uncomfortable and numb within the first hour or so of use.  I kept switching back and forth between this mouse and my previous one to see if I was just imagining it, but every time I switched to the old mouse, the feeling would go away.The mouse also feels a lot heavier than my previous mouse, even though it's technically only 6 grams heavier according to advertising.  Part of what made this apparent is that the sides are very soft, and because of the weight my thumb wouldn't grip the side and would start to slip up the mouse after repeated lifting to move the mouse around.I imagine that if I fully palm gripped my mice and moved my whole arm instead of claw gripping at all, the slipperiness and weight wouldn't be as bad.  But the wrist issue was still there even when I experimented with that.I wanted to go with Logitech because I already use their MX Keys keyboard, and I could use their mouse and their keyboard with one dongle.  But their next closest mouse with the same battery life shrinks from this sleek looking beast, to a compact mouse really just meant for travel or for children.  Logitech has some more typically sized mice, but the wireless variants have a matter of dozens of hours of battery life instead of 70 days like this one.  I'm already charging the keyboard every couple of weeks since I need the backlight, so I really didn't want a mouse with the same limitation even without a backlight.Going to go with a different brand that does offer more typical ergonomics/size and high battery life.",5-May-22
519,M,4,"Logitech makes some great peripherals. This mouse is for you if you have large hands like me. It fits very comfortably and the button/scrolling positioning on it is set perfectly where it doesn't get in the way of movement.  Battery life is great on it and I am overall very happy with it along with their wireless ergonomic keyboard.My only complaint is their bluetooth connectivity. Sometimes it would take awhile to connect back on or I would have to turn off the mouse and turn it back on after waking my computer from sleep mode. I know there is a usb  dongle connector for it, but I don't like to use up my ports when I don't have to. If they can get that issue resolved this product would be perfect.",4-May-22

525,Phillip Adams,5,"Ok, let’s do some quick math. 14.359 reviews of which 95% gave it at least 4 out of 5 stars, which the vast majority (around 86%) gave it 5.

That’s how I do all my PC/Mac related shopping- find the one with the most reviews AND at least 90% and up gave it 4-5 stars.This mouse is probably the best mouse I’ve ever owned. Using the dongle ensures a better connection (I haven’t even tried the Bluetooth connectivity). The software you download to customize the buttons/wheels is superb- easy to use and very intuitive while still offering plenty of tweaks. I hope this helps someone.

527,grinder,4,"After having used this mouse for several weeks I can say it functions somewhat well. All the advertised functions work as expected other than the Flow feature (allowing one mouse to work on multiple computers).I have two computers, both on the same wired network. Each computer has the same USB-Bluetooth dongle. The problem lies somewhere within the mouse being able to detect screen edges. I have it set hold control (or any other key press) while moving the pointer to the edge which should allow the pointer to cross over. Unfortunately, if I get close to the edge the pointer will go over to the other screen/computer and interrupt my workflow. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. There's no pattern. Irritating, but I guess I'll live with it.",1-May-22
528,Kevin W.,3,"This mouse fits my (larger) hand well. The shape means it is for righties only but that is fine by me. The precision is the best I've used on a mouse to date and while it is a bit pricey it would be worth the price if the multi-device capabilities were more complete. This device pairs with the MX Keys keyboard and they both have the ability to toggle from computer to computer so you can use one mouse &amp; keyboard to control up to three devices. There is some additional driver software you can load on your Windows or Mac (or both) PC's that let you use mouse movements to toggle between computers. When you do this with the mouse both the keyboard and the mouse switch from device A to device B and back again. It works pretty slick. The keyboard has some extra keys that also let you toggle between devices and the mouse has a button underneath. A major flaw, in my view, is that when you use the keys or buttons to switch from computer to computer, the keyboard and mouse do not both switch at once. The mouse software has an option that lets you control whether you want this when you use mouse movement to switch devices but there is no options when using the keys/buttons. If you want to switch computers you have to press the button on the keyboard (very handy) and then pick up the mouse, turn it over, and press another button one or two times, depending on what device you want to switch to. It works but it isn't very user friendly. Ideally, I could press the key on the keyboard to choose the computer and when the keyboard changes over the mouse would too.",29-Apr-22

530,Health Nut &amp; Tech Guy,1,"WARNING:  I have been using this mouse since Christmas (less than 4 months) and I'm actively looking to find its replacement.The scroll wheel is entirely inconsistent.  Sometimes it scrolls one line at a time (rarely). Other times it's 10 lines or even whole pages go flying by.  There is also a lag when you use it.  It behaves differently on each piece of software, and it really freaks out if you use anything other than windows (like a virtualization window, for example).  The DPI on the mouse itself is not adjustable; everything is done via software, which gives it a strange feel.  Also, when windows first boots up your mouse will be soooooo slow until the supporting software loads.  In the bios: slow as hell.  In non-windows (Linux): also slow as hell.  The DPI must be VERY LOW on this mouse.There are videos online about how to take it apart and fix the scroll wheel, but when I pay $100 for a mouse I shouldn't have to do repairs on it frequently.  (the fix is temporary, so they suggest you leave the screws out since you'll be doing the repair a lot).The left mouse button struggles on dropdowns in every web browser I've tested.  It will drop down the selections and close them back up you will wonder if it ever opened to begin with.  Which will lead you to clicking it again... and again... and again like Russian Roulette until you win the prize of that click leaving the dropdown open.  It's a blast on every online order with a state dropdown.  (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Brave &amp; Safari tested).It honestly feels like someone is pulling a gag on you when you use this mouse.  Yes, it's big, but I have no complaints about the size or ergonomics.  I like the thumb rest and the thumb scroll wheel is a welcome and clever addition that scrolls a bit slow, but at least it's consistent, so I have no complaints.  The battery life is amazing, and it charges VERY FAST.  I use it all day, and rarely do I need to charge it, and when I do, it's ready to rock for weeks on less than an hour's charge.  Perhaps it's the big battery that makes it heavy.  So heavy that if you use finger placement at 131 you will probably need to change to 122  as your pinky will struggle after hours of use, or you'll start accidentally right-clicking as you pull the mouse.I've been working on PCs since they first came out (8086, 8088, and my first build of a 286 (Commodore Amiga &amp; 64 before that), and during those four decades, I've used hundreds of mice and many of them have been made by Logitec (my mouse before this one was a Logitech) and I can say with 100% certainty that this is the most frustrating mouse I have ever used in all my life.The negative feelings I have for the performance of this mouse borderlines on hate.",27-Apr-22

533,cesar villegas,1,"This is my second MX Master 3, great mouse all around and my top choice.This review is about the seller and a warning to others. I received this mouse in what appeared to be perfectly new packaging and had no doubts about the product and it worked out of the box, although it was odd that it was completely dead and I had to charge it but no big deal. Second day, I noticed that the pads at the bottom were very scratched, like those of a mouse with a lot of use... The rest of the mouse didn't show many signs of wear though. I didn't have any other proof that the mouse was used so i decided to keep it... Fast forward a few days and this mouse will die within 24hrs even if its turned off. That's an issue I cant live with.So just a warning. Check and make sure you are actually receiving a NEW mouse like you ordered. This was either a dishonest seller at worst, or perhaps I was sold an item that was returned to the ""as new"" and not verified.",26-Apr-22
534,Lazarus Dark,5,"First, latency: there is none. I've been using an MX Performance since 2011, and the original MX before that. I didn't realize how much lag I had before, because this thing has so little latency, I swear it registered button presses before I even pressed them, like some kinda Jedi mouse. Like the button presses would register onscreen before my brain finished registering that I'd pressed it.Being able to switch it quickly from connecting to my work laptop to my home PC with the button on the bottom is wonderful, no more swapping the USB receiver back and forth!Ergonomics are great, at least as good as previous MX, and the size and ergonomic are big factors for me, I have large hands.The scroll wheel is better than ever, like fine silk linen, I can't believe they've managed to continue making it feel better, when it was already the best feeling scroll wheel ever back in the original version over 15 years ago.The thumb wheel feels great to spin, also silky smooth, but I'm not sure yet about the placement or usefulness, I still prefer the original thumb wheel which was more of a rocker switch.CON: the back/forward buttons are too small, slightly awkwardly placed and take too much effort to press. It's kinda bizarre, everything else seems so well thought out and engineered, but the forward/back buttons feel ripped off a five dollar mouse. This is very unfortunate as I use these buttons heavily. I think I can get used to it, but it's a big disappointment for an otherwise amazingly good mouse.",26-Apr-22

540,Kainoa68,4,"I’ve been using one of the original Logitech Wave ergonomic keyboard and mouse combos for years. Loved the functionality and comfort of both. However, the keys weren’t working so well anymore and since it was old school tech, it was pretty noise when on calls. Decided to stick with Logitech and got both, the MX series keyboard and the mouse.Design &amp; Ergonomics:The shape of mouse gives is an advanced and modern look to it. Metallic gray plastic mixed with matte black with sculpted lines add to the visual appeal. The bright silver metal scroll knobs stand out in contrast to the body.For my hand, it is very comfortable and my palm is supported by the shape of the mouse. The thumb rest are is helpful (since my previous mouse didn’t have one) so that my thumb can actually rest on the mouse, instead of older style mice where you are using the thumb pad and ring finger/pinky to actually hold the mouse. The whole design allows you to keep your hand relaxed and move it, your wrist and forearm as a unit reducing stress.Buttons are within easy reach of thumb or index finger. Most of the buttons and scroll knobs have the right amount of resistance so that you know that you are actuating a click or roll with out exerting a lot of pressure. The exception are the page forward/back buttons. These are stiffer. I’m not sure if that is because they went cheap there or if it is on purpose because they both sit very close to your thumb pad and could be unintentionally pressed if there was less resistance.I should mention this, but since the mouse does cradle your palm, it is actually very tall. I can’t tell if it is because the MX keyboard sits so low due to its slim design or my muscle memory from using my old mouse, but when deep into my work and blindly reaching for the mouse, I am not clearing the top of it and wind up knocking it off the keyboard tray. Hopefully, I get used to it soon before I break it.Functionality/Connectivity:Almost all of the buttons on the mouse can be customized through the Logitech software. Some are already set to operate differently when using programs like MS Office. Even in its default setting, the mouse has the functions you need 75% of the time, like page forward/back, left click, right, show open windows, zoom in/out, pointer scroll, tactile/free scroll.The mouse can be connected via dongle or Bluetooth directly to your computer. Some other reviewers have mentioned it, but the dongle they give you is USB-A. I am assuming the reason is that if you have USB-C, then you probably have built in Bluetooth and don’t need the dongle. I have mine hooked up directly to two of my computers and toggle between them. Yeah, I said two. The MX series allows you to connect to up to 3 computers and toggle between them. The keyboard has three button which make it easy to switch the keyboard between computers. ***My one and only complaint*** The mouse has the button to change between the computers on the bottom. Every time you want to change between computers, you have to pick up the mouse and push the button. How stupid is that! Okay, so you are able to customize the buttons so let’s just assign the function to one of them to, right? Nope, can’t do it. This definitely needs to be fixed – Logitech that’s just being a bonehead. In the 3 months using it, I have not had any problems with connectivity.Quality/Durability:So far so good. Seems to be holding up well and haven’t had any problems with it considering the number of times I have knocked if of the keyboard tray and on the hardwood floor (no cushioning there).Overall, this is mouse works as I’d like it too so can’t really complain other than the bad location of the computer switch. The MX as a whole, is on the expensive side, but the quality and feel of the products, including this mouse are all top notch. A definite keeper.",24-Apr-22
541,Ken,3,I love this mouse however I get a brief flash on my screen when the batter is at a critical low. I spoke with the manufacturer and they told me there is nothing they could do.

<span> I have had this Logitech mouse for a few years now, and I am still in LOVE with it. Would I rebuy it should this one ever fail, absolutely.It feels great in the hand, is super responsive, is fast when you need it to be, always connects, and just works.By far, it is one of the best investments that I have made in my desk setup, and along with the matching keyboard and the Logi mousepad, they make a great set.",21-Apr-22
543,TEXAS AUTO,5,"I use it with my mac studio, it is absolutely the best.",21-Apr-22
544,Mike M,5,"Mac user here and for years, the thought of using anything else was alien to me. I had no idea how useful this could be for things like video editing or simply just searching the web, and with my large hands, this mouse is a perfect fit for me. 👍",21-Apr-22
545,Randall C. Page,5,"If I could give this mouse more stars, I would.",21-Apr-22
546,boop,5,OMG! I can’t believe I am taking the time to review this.1. Great for anyone with hand pain.2. Very smooth3. Can assign shortcuts for repeated tasks4. Most I have spent on a mouse but would definitely purchase another one if this stopped working.Love 💕 this mouse!!Highly recommended would give it 10 ⭐️ if I could!!,21-Apr-22
547,Reichard Könige,3,"The MX Master 3 mouse has a few issues. Firstly ergonomics.  It may be fine for a someone that uses a claw hand hold with their mouse but if you do a full palm hold you'll find yourself gliding off the back and continously having to readjust. There's also a gesture button that's in a position difficult to activate while attempting the ridiculous gesture.Then there is software.  Logitech Options is for people that don't ever exit microsoft apps or web browsers. If you do any form of software development then skip this. While options allows you to assign keystrokes it does not allow multiple keystrokes. So emacs and visual studio code folk can forget it. And while you normally stay on the keyboard for those apps there are plenty of reasons or places where you would want the programmable mouse buttons to be flexible enough to send multiple key presses. If this mouse could make use of ghub those short comings would be addressed but you'll still have a problem if you like to rest your palm on the mouse. I used to have the G602 for productivity and it was heaven. But it suffered from the double click and eventually no clicks issue. They sell a G502 now but the reviews are horrible so I may switch to a Razer Naga.Update: purchased the g604 and its everything you need. Comfortable, plenty of programable button features, high dpi, onbosrd memory... the only downside is it's scroll wheel.  It's about as good as the g602 but the MX Master 3 scroll wheel is far better. A minor thing. GHub software is a hot mess but it's workable. I'll review separately.",20-Apr-22
548,J. Pat,5,From all aspects…perfect. Must have in life kind of product,20-Apr-22
549,Stephan McGinnis,1,This is the second time I brought this mouse and the scroll button free spins I hope everybody sees this comment and stay away from this pathetic mouse.,19-Apr-22
550,Irina,5,"UPDATE: it’s past 7 month and it’s my first time charging it, great battery life.Well, this mouse is super comfy and fit very well.My hand never gets tired and sits always right. If you are a big guy with big hands then this is it. I ordered probably a last year and haven’t charged it. The battery lasts for years and you don’t have to think about charging it. Honestly I don’t really use the fast scroller but it’s a cool future, the side scroller is super useful if you use the excel. Lastly, the bottoms on the side is right where it’s needed, I don’t have to use the keyboard or click on the screen to go back. I glad I bought this mouse and highly recommend for anyone who is working from their Laptops. Not sure if this mouse is made for gaming, never tested, probably not the best for gamers tho.",17-Apr-22
551,AReviewer,5,Worth every penny. The customizability of it and the ease of use is unparalleled. It made me leave my Magic Mouse with such ease. Ended up buying two of these (1 for each of my workspaces).,16-Apr-22
552,David J. Phillips,5,I love this mouse. Probably my favorite mouse ever! I have pretty large hands and it fits my hand perfect. The buttons are in a nice spot. I love the smooth scroll wheel. 100% recommended.Update: I just bought the Logitech MX Keys keyboard to pair with this mouse. couldn't be happier. perfect products. a must have but not cheap. but well made to fit the price tag.,16-Apr-22

556,Eren,5,As a mac user I was a bit worried it would take a lot of adjusting to the Logitech mouse coming from a Magic Mouse user but it was pretty seamless and tons of nice features. Also the way it just fits in the palm is just right. Really worth the purchase. Battery life is fantastic.,14-Apr-22
557,Kevin Hovdestad,1,"Just the shoddiest mouse I've ever bought. The M1 Macs don't recognize it as a mouse for the purposes of disabling the trackpad, and the edges of the feet catch on things all the time. The scroll wheel behavior is awful - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's painfully slow. Doesn't matter if I swap to the USB receiver or use it on Windows instead.Probably the most disappointing mouse I've owned in 25 years of PC peripheral use.",14-Apr-22
558,Naina,5,"I have a setup of an iMac, Macbook Air and HP laptop (from work). So being able to control these 3 devices with 1 keyboard-mouse setup makes my life so much easier. 100% recommended.",14-Apr-22

560,Peter W.,5,I like the Logi MX Verticle too - but this one has a left/right scroll wheel that makes operating on spread sheets a breeze.The extra button for my thumb lets me process emails more efficiently too.,12-Apr-22
561,Amazon Customer,4,"Was replacing an old mouse with this one. I wish it was clickier. The L/R buttons are noticeably harder to click either because of the way the mouse is structured (mouse is large and finger is stretched out hence weaker) or because they're physically sturdier, but I swapped for another of logitech's lighter mouses. Maybe I'm just weak lol",12-Apr-22
562,Amazonian,5,"I have two MacBook Pros (one for work, one personal) with a KVM switch in between.  This mouse (combined with the MX Keys for Mac) is absolutely fantastic.  A word of advice:  if you're setting up a similar scenario, do NOT order the ""MX Master 3 for Mac"".  Despite the description, that model does NOT have the USB adapter -- it's actually Bluetooth only.  THIS is the model you want.",11-Apr-22

565,Mario Behr,1,"This mouse stutters across the screen, causing some kind of weird screen redraw on my Mac. Sometimes it times out and doesn't respond mid scroll. It was so frustrating and killed my productivity. I couldn't figure out what was causing it, so I just plugged in an old mouse. Problem solved. I'll be returning this.",11-Apr-22
566,Dr. Ann,5,I love the ergonomic design of this mouse. I work from home and am on the computer most of the day. This mouse keeps my hand from experiencing overuse pain/injuries.,11-Apr-22
567,Logan,5,"Love the feel of this mouse, everything about it feels premium and comfortable. I especially love the quiet metal scroll wheels over the previous mx  masters. I was surprised at how light it was though, maybe just personal preference but I’d love a little more weight so it doesn’t take so much effort to make precise movements, maybe adjustable weights in the mx master 4?",11-Apr-22
568,Amazon Customer,3,"Wish this lived up to the hype, but unfortunately the scroll wheel eventually was a deal breaker. It's great for going through pages quickly, until you need to stop and move around accurately. The freewheel would just bounce around, and prevented controlled use like when you want to scroll smaller amounts.Ergonomics and functionality otherwise we're great. Wish it could have worked out.",10-Apr-22
569,Qudratullah Rajavi,3,It's a great mouse BUT...1. the scroll stutters and also it is not consistent!2. the side buttons are located too low! and my thumb touches them which is uncomfortable to work at least for me!! I wish the side buttons were placed a little higher!,9-Apr-22
570,Damian,5,Ergonomic in the hand. I love the side scroll. The weight of the scroll wheel is fantastic. Even better then the MX Master (1).,9-Apr-22
571,Robby  Wert,5,With this mouse you can use any surface. The other thing is you can program the mouse buttons as needed. You can also connect to 3 different devices. I have multiple versions of this mouse and I have been very happy with its performance.,8-Apr-22
572,HFG_All the Wonderful Things,1,If you wanted a (CLICK SILENT) mouse - this is not it!!!!!The scroll nob is silent - not the left &amp; right click pads.For $99 this mouse is a flop for not being able to customize and have SILENCE as an option.,7-Apr-22
573,Miles,3,"I love the house, but either firmware on the mouser or, more likely the logi software on macOS Monterey stops the scroll wheel and other logi specific functions from working every few days requiring a computer restart to fix.

576,Leo Fio,5,"Once configured, this makes the 3 button mice you've likely been using for years seem like they are in the stone age. A common complaint about this mouse is the scroll wheel. I was having problems as well, with it clicking/making noise and not responding well. It works great since I changed the scroll wheel mode from ratchet to free spin.The ability to seamlessly control multiple computers from one mouse is a killer feature. Soon after purchasing this, I picked up the MX keys to go with it.",5-Apr-22
577,Amazon Customer,5,The best mouse ever,4-Apr-22
578,PJ Y,4,"(Bought with my desktop but I leave my reviews on AMZN where I do most of my shopping.)They say this is the top productivity mouse, and that seems close to true.  There are three main reasons:1.  The side wheel is awesome -- though not quite as useful as I expected.  I wonder if I should go back to a side tilt scroll wheel.2.  Customization per app is awesome to have.  However, the software is not as good as it should be, and it is hard to copy profiles from one to another.  E.g. why would anyone want different settings for Chrome vs Firefox vs Edge etc.?3.  Gesture button is innovative and super helpful.  When you get used to them, gestures turn any mouse button into 5!  That's really great for those of us who want more customization.  For example, on Chrome I use these 4 of these gestures on one buttons for closest tab, reopen tab, new tab, and refresh.  Super useful.  (Don't forget forward and back page, as well as forward and back tab, are already there own buttons/scrolls!  What CAN'T you control???)  That said, as a power user, I would still appreciate even more buttons.  I am not sure why they dont add at least one button each for ring finger and pinky on the right, and perhaps an extra button at upper left.  These are all innovations Razer has put in, and I wish for here.Negatives:  While I do think this is probably the best productivity mouse currently on the market, it is still not perfect.  I take off 1 star for the following reasons (some already mentioned above):A.  Software is imperfect. Very hard to set everything up with full power, because there's no way to copy profiles or edit the mappings in a text document.  Very frustrating to then try to copy (for example) my four gesture buttons from Chrome to the other three browsers I use.  And BTW, some of the defaults are wrong -- e.g. right scroll on Excel is scrolling the thumbwheel LEFT (WHAT???).B.  Not enough buttons.  Why not give us more right hand buttons and upper left?C.  Flow doesn't work well.  I spent weeks trying to setup my machines.  Google for it and you'll see many people proposing all kinds of strange solutions for getting things past firewalls, etc.  And on top of that the customer service is terrible -- they couldn't figure it out and didn't respond to my for weeks, while I figured it out myself.  Should be easier for them to figure out their own software.That's it for now.  Stay tuned and I will soon be posting review also for MX Keys Mini, Litra Glow, etc.  Foreshadowing:  they won't be as good as this one!!!",4-Apr-22

581,PATRICK S.,1,"I tried out a bunch of premium mice at a local big box electronic store and the MX3 felt the best overall.But when I connected the mouse to my own Fedora 35 workstation the flaws came out.I'd get weird scrolling happening suddenly in apps, or Chrome tabs being flipped through randomly, or my editor fonts being scaled down all with no warning. This happened randomly a few times a day.I tried three different systems and all had the same issues (2 * Fedora 35 and an Ubuntu 20 system), I tried with a MacBook Pro over a few days and the mouse worked fine there.I also verified that the firmware was up to date.I tried wired and wireless connections and that made no difference.Unfortunately the mouse was beyond the return period by the time I determined the issues were with the mouse and not my systems.So if you are a Linux user I cannot recommend this mouse.",1-Apr-22
582,Amazon Customer,5,The mouse is more then what I hoped for. It connects to multiple computers and easily transfers/ copies/pastes files between different computers. I used to send files by email to my other computers - now I just drag them over. One mouse for multiple computers and seamless transfer of the mouse pointer between the different screens. Highly recommend. There are issues with bluetooth even when using a dongle. But one posting addressing this problem stated putting the dongle close to one of the screens - this has totally resolved the lagging issue of the pointer and I have nt had any issues since.,1-Apr-22
583,birch915,3,"It's a great mouse. But DO NOT buy it if you plan to use it while on VPN. Flow won't work properly. Options+ (the app for customization) can't load half of the time. You get logged off from platforms (supported under VPN only) every few minutes. I simply can't get my job done with this mouse.Besides I'm a MacBook Pro user. There's a way to change the scroll direction, but that'll mess up your touch pad scroll direction at the same time. Unless you rarely use touch pad, otherwise not handy for MacBook users.",1-Apr-22
584,robolab,1,"I thought spending $100 on a mouse would translate to easy use and a stress free life. Nope. I'm sure the mouse is great, but it has trouble staying connected on Windows 10, even after all the annoying drivers and software-- for a MOUSE.I'm going to be trying so hard to get a refund for this useless thing.",31-Mar-22
585,Teddy K.,3,"As a general mouse, it's brilliant. The shape, the design, the buttons, construction, all excellent. The scroll wheel doesn't rattle like the MX2.When it comes to the fancier features like Flow and customizability, it's disappointing. It feels like there are some major oversights from Logitech, like not allowing you to remap the multi-device button TO SOMEWHERE ACTUALLY CONVENIENT LIKE THE TOP! That's not an issue when the Flow feature works, allowing you to move the cursor across two separate devices, but the reliability of the Flow is frustrating. The flow inexplicably stops working at random times for random durations. Sometimes it's due to dodgy internet, but my internet seemed totally fine today and flow refused to work until the workday ended, then it decided to resume flawless function. For such a useful feature to be hamstrung by bugginess is really disappointing, with insult to injury being the multi-device button being on the bottom.I wish I had gone with the cheaper triathlon model, which has the multi-device button on the top, since the Flow can't be relied on.",30-Mar-22

588,Nick,4,"This mouse feels solid and comfortable to the hand. It’s responsive on Bluetooth but I haven’t used it with usb.<br>The mouse has lots of buttons but doesn’t look gimmicky.What I wish this mouse would improve on is how a user selects a different device to use the mouse in. Currently in order to switch the mouse to another device, you have to turn the mouse over and select a button which toggles between 1,2 and 3 selections. It would be best if if the device selector was located at the top or side of the mouse. Having to switch becomes frustrating lifting turning over selecting a device.</br>",28-Mar-22

590,E Seto,5,"When I took an ergonomics course in grad school, I learned that it can actually be detrimental to have a tool that is overly molded to the grip of a particular hand shape, as it can lock your hand into a particular position, where it can cramp, exacerbate repetitive motions, etc.  That said, I've been a long time user of Logitech's MX mice, starting with the MX Performance that had the same general hand shape as this MX Master 3.  There have been subtle changes over the years.  If they still made the original MX Performance, I think I'd still prefer to use that one.  The MX Master 3 still has the same feel though, and I like the weight of the mouse and its roller cam scroll wheel.  So I keep going back to this family of mice.",27-Mar-22

For something that I use all day, 5 days a week, it's a luxury that just makes the workday easier. The double-wheel is fantastic for wide documents, really a nice feature, and the 'fast scroll' on the primary wheel works well too. (I've not tried to control more than one machine with it, so can't speak to that feature.)One thing to consider is it's on the large size as mice go, so if you have smaller hands I'd keep that in mind. I give it 4 out of 5 stars overall, but you may well find it 5-star. Recommended!",25-Mar-22

Almost every video. I don't game so I don't want an official gaming mouse. I was able to program volume on the Horizontal wheel for volume and mute on the scroll wheel. Forward and back buttons.

612,R. Finderson,5,"Charge on this mouse lasts seemingly forever, which is very nice.  I have one at office, and one for home/travel. Software allows you to run off a single usb dongle to free up usb ports, also a terrific convenience.  Just do not have both mouse in same area, both turned on.  The interference will cause the mice to not function properly. Just turn one off and good to go.  The scroll wheel has multiple setting, which allows you to work faster, or slower, varying with your needs. Its look and feel are also terrific. I have larger hands, but it does not feel small. It has heft to it, and feels solid. I have had one of these for over a year, and have had zero issues with it.  Zero.  How many times can you say that of a mouse? It is why I bought a second, mostly so I do not have to carry the mouse back and forth to work. Pricey, I know, but I feel well worth it.",13-Mar-22

If you are planning to use this mouse between 2 or more computers, you may want to look for a device that will have the ability to switch between computers without picking up the mouse.The Logitech Keyboards have a suitable set of buttons to switch between devices but those buttons do not switch the mouse as well. Logitech has stated repeatedly that they are not planning to implement this and are focusing on their Flow software.Flow software has some major limitations and often does not work on permissions restricted computers using VPN. If you have a work computer that has software controls and you cannot install the Logitech software, this Flow feature will not work. In some cases, when it is installed, it stops working and you have to reset your devices. I have used several variants and do prefer them when they are able to apply to a desk setup. If you cannot use the Logitech software on one or more computers, you will need to manually lift the mouse to switch between computers.",9-Mar-22

621,BC123,2,"Unfortunately, this does not pair seamlessly with the MX Jeys keyboard. On fast Wi-Fi, there is a noticeable lag with keyboard movements, and the rechargeable battery is not sufficient for intense use without plugging regularly to recharge. While the hyper scrolling is helpful in some applications, there is overall extremely small increase in efficiency over a standard wired mouse. Would not recommend.",6-Mar-22
622,Nlitend Theory,5,"I wish that there was a fusion between the Logitech G502 Hero wireless mouse, Logitech MX 3 mouse, and the ReDragon M801P Sniper Pro wireless mouse and the Razer Basilisk Ultimate. I don't understand why all other mice on the market do not have a hyper scroll capability yet. If the ReDragon M801P mouse had this hyper scroll wheel. I would love it because of the format of being able to wrest my ring finger on the mouse channel. It is so hard to find a good ergonomic mouse on the market today with great features.If that M801P ergonomic palm and finger wrest shape, as well as the scroll wheel placement and the RGB lighting was combined with the click ability of G502 Hero mouse buttons and button placement (including the middle finger length of the right mouse click). Was merged with the MX 3 mouse's perfected hyper scroll wheel, the thumb wheel functionality and programmability, as well as the ergonomic thumb rest shape, it would be the absolute perfect mouse! I totally had no idea how useful the thumbwheel would be until I started using. Its programmability makes it so useful!I found that with the functionality of the MX 3 Mouse, I am so much faster and enjoy doing the work now that I found tedious before. I get so much done; it is ridiculous! The combination of using this mouse with Logitech G915 keyboard makes me so much faster that I don't want to stop getting things done. I found that I can do stuff that I never could before typing wise with the G915. That is why I'm writing so much on this review. It doesn't even bother me at all since it doesn't take very long to do this. Work kind of feels like videogaming right now.Basically, the Razer Basilisk Ultimate has a RGB superior lighting capability as well as a better overall ergonomic shape feel than the G502 Hero. I had purchased it first and ended up returning it because the right click was missing clicks and the scroll wheel adjustment didn't reach the level of not ratcheting at all. The G502 simply had better clicking buttons and the hyper scroll wheel over the Basilisk Ultimate. Though the placement of the hyper scroll wheel forces one to shift their hand too much because its is to close to the second joint on the index finger. That is why I ended up returning the G502 and purchasing the MX 3 mouse.Recently I was forced to search for a new ergonomic wireless mouse.I previously had the original Logitech M705 portable mouse for around a decade. Finally wore it out to the point where the receiver would not connect. I loved the hyper scroll functionality of the mouse, as well as the ergonomics of thumb rest pocket curve. The forward and back buttons were a welcome addition, though I had to move my thumb far to reach them. The Issue with this mouse was that it was too small since it was meant for portability.When the original MX mouse came onto the market, I had no desire for it since the ergonomics and features were poor.Before purchasing this MX 3 Mouse I acquired the G502 Hero wireless and it was awesome except for the positioning of the scroll wheel, the thumb rest curvature, the coating on the mouse caused me to sweat and the mouse would slip in my hand, and finally the width of the mouse was too small for properly wresting one’s hand on. The MX 3 mouse wheel without the rubber grip is way better for feel and longevity over the G502 Hero wireless. The rubber on my original M705 mouse had worn loose after about a year or two of use and I had to cut it off in order to continue using the hyper scroll functionality. The G502 has a rubber on it which probably means it will loosen over time.The bad thing about the MX 3 mouse is that the forward and back buttons are small cheap plastic buttons that are difficult to press, unlike the G502 buttons. The hump that is put into the palm wrest behind the thumb wheel is just overkill and bad ergonomics. You end up having a hard surface jutting into the root bone socket of your index finger. The curvature of the M801P is much more conducive to the natural ergonomic flow of the palm.The right and left mouse click buttons on the MX 3 mouse are too loud and put up too much resistance. The right click's size is too narrow to allow for clicking all the time without running into the outer border of the mouse. The G502 had the perfect balance of size, shape and reactivity in comparison to the MX 3 mouse. A major issue I run into with the MX 3 mouse is that my index will accidentally brush ever so slightly against the hyper scroll wheel when it is on infinite scroll, and I am trying to rotate the thumb wheel while navigating an image gallery. This causes the gallery to start moving based on the infinite scroll.This issue could be avoided if the MX 3 mouse had finger channels like the G502, or the Razer Basilisk or even the M801P has. Though the M801P's right click is not as long and therefore it is possible for one's finger to slip over the end of it.I hope in the future Logitech, Razer, or ReDragon will implement the changes that I mentioned here and make the perfect mouse that could be used for either gaming or productivity.",6-Mar-22

626,VRWizard,2,"I really wanted to like the mouse but it is perhaps the most unreliable mouse I have ever owned. At least once every minute it experienced judder like it isn't staying connected to its receiver. At first this was annoying but now it is debilitating. Definitely can not be used for any form of online gaming but beyond that it makes office tasks feel clunky and off. I have tried moving its receiver to different USB Ports... Both 2.0 and 3.0. Neither made any difference. The mouse and keyboard sit about 1.5 feet away from the receiver. Just seems like either terrible drivers or a seriously flawed connection setup.This is a shame since I love both the mouse and keyboard but this is by far the worst wireless setup I have ever experienced from both a mouse and a keyboard. Definitely steer away from this product.Also, I am on a $4,000 production tower. 3090 GPU and top tier CPU. No reason at all for these issues.",2-Mar-22

628,Ben S,3,"I use this on PC and Mac. Scrolling is terrible and jittery on Mac, even with smooth scrolling enabled. I used an unverified app called Mos that worked pretty well but it's kind of a pain to switch on and off when I use other mice. It came with a unifying receiver, but I bought MX Keys Mini with Bolt. They are apparently incompatible and I have to use 2 dongles in my PC.  The mouse is much greyer in person than it appeared in the pictures. The horizontal wheel is pretty useless by default. You can switch tabs in the browser, which if you're like me you'll use more accidentally than on purpose. I've used a lot of Logitech mice and this is one of the least customizable. Not even a left/right click on the wheel. Logitech Flow software (for me anyway) is terrible. You fight and fight it to go to the other screen, then it slings and you can't find it. On Mac mission control and swiping between apps is a little wonky and feels a little homemade... but not completely terrible. The bottom scratches up within the first few hours of use (which is true with most or all Logitech mice.) AND THE MEGA KICKER: If you have a MX Keys keyboard you want to switch computer/devices, you need to push both the button on the mouse and the button on the keyboard in order to go from one computer to the next. There are people who have homebrewed a solution out there but it takes more reading/research/figuring out than I'm willing to go through.",2-Mar-22

I don't have oversized bear claw hands and am an average build person. When using this mouse, I could not fully relax my hand, as soon as I did, my middle finger would be enough weight to constantly trigger a right click and it was annoying.

Most folks won't notice this, but if you have small hands and short fingers, make sure to get it from a seller who allows returns.

SmartShift is best left off at all times, and smooth scrolling doesn't help make the scrolling more accurate.I got the MX hoping it'd be a suitable replacement for my G9 which succumbed to the phantom double clicking issue, but this 3rd iteration of the MX Master can't even hold a candle to the G9.

You can make the mouse do different things when you are using different programs which is perfect for when you're watching movies etc. I like that it has a metal scroll wheel because that is the first thing to usually mess up on a mouse. One thing it doesn't have though is the side to side click for the scroll wheel but I'm actually glad about this because the scroll wheel is usually what messes up on a mouse and you don't have to worry about it with this one. Because all it does is scroll and middle button click. The scroll wheel on the side is also programmable to be many different things like zoom and volume or whatever.

Actually, what makes this worse is that there's not just a delay in whatever document you are scrolling, but it just doesn't happen.

659,aculphur,1,"The idea of scrolling past hundred of lines (~1000!) per second is very appealing, especially for long pages of code. I liked being able to switch between 2 modes, ratchet and free wheel. The free wheel mode is mostly okay but is it is not nearly as fast as it promised to be. It is much faster than a regular mouse but at the same time it takes some practice to be able to stop the wheel momentum and aim at the right spot. The rachet mode, on the other hand, is a mess. This is what should resemble the most a regular mouse.  Unlike a normal mouse, the scrolling motion on screen somehow stops before the wheel stops rolling,. You can literally see the wheel keep rolling and the screen stays motionless. To me this was unacceptable, especially for such an expensive mouse. The freewheel mode is almost completely silent, but when you stop the motion to stop a given spot on a long page it makes loud ""thunk"" noise which at the beginning is satisfying but in the long run feels like a gimmick and becomes annoying.",15-Feb-22

I ended up getting a travel case for it, hasn't arrived yet.Also, you charge it with usb c, but you can't use the usb c connection as a wired connection, which would truly make this the best mouse, so instead I just leave it plugged in.I also want to say for anyone looking to gift this, this is NOT a gaming mouse. Gaming mice are all about precession and usually wired. This is a great mouse for anyone, and you CAN game on it, but if someone is a ""gamer"" they'll want a different mouse. That being said if you're casual or don't really care about being super precise and super fast, this mouse works just fine. Just writing this section for any soccer moms who are gifting their son this thinking it's a ""gaming mouse;"" it's not (but still an awesome gift)Overall: perfect in every way except wish it could be wired with usb c and wish there was a place for the dongle inside the mouse.",4-Feb-22

685,Robert J. Huddleston,4,"Lagging: 1. Turn off Windows Device Sleep mode. 2. Move 2.4 KHz modem as far as possible from mouse 3. Revive Response by holding mouse less than 6 inches from Dongle. Rear mounted Dongle was useless. Front panel mounted Dongle got best results. This trick works every time!!! Mouse gets a ""lock"" on the Dongle that lasts over an hour in most cases. Refresh takes less than 2 sec. Remember, Mother Nature doesn't care what you want, She has her own rules. Perhaps a Firmware upgrade will improve stability. I will add 5 KHz modem and disable 2.4 KHz to see if stability improves more. Have a Happy Day!",2-Feb-22

688,Noah,3,"The MX Master 3 is a good mouse for the right person. For those seeking a gaming mouse or similar, this ain't it. The MX Master 3 is burdensomely heavy (141g) and simply not at all shaped properly to be used for gaming. The DPI adjustment is poor at best because you can't set a number, like 1800 DPI for example - all the software has is an arbitrary slider like that of which the Windows Settings app offers. I suppose you could say that I bought this mouse not understanding who it is designed for, but I have used ergo mice in the past and been happy with them so I expected the MX Master 3 to be a good mouse for me. Unfortunately, that's not quite the case.My biggest gripe with this mouse is that the shape is designed in such a way to cater to almost any grip style and hand size, leading to the mouse being uncomfortable and almost frustrating to use. It forces a palm grip based on the fundamental shape, being ergonomic, but the small details like the raised edge at the back where the heel of your hand rests and the lack of an area to rest the tips of your ring and little fingers on the front left side also play a part in the discomfort I experience during use. As I have used the mouse more, I've become familiar enough with the shape that it is bearable, but only just. I am considering switching to a Razer Pro Click instead.Thankfully, I have not experienced any of the miss-click or double click issues that I've heard are fairly common for this mouse, and other than the disappointing DPI adjustment the sensor seems to be good enough. Both scroll wheels are very nice to use, although the main scroll wheel is very hard to click which is annoying for me because I click the scroll wheel a lot when using other mice.",1-Feb-22

I don't use the mouse for gaming, but for a lot of Zoom meetings and document, spreadsheet, and presentation work.  The extra scrool wheel and buttons (that can be customized per application) are truly game-changer.  Highly recommended.",28-Jan-22

696,Bray Addison,2,"Unfortunately this mouse caused a lot of pain to develop in my wrist. It's not very ergonomic. It pushes your wrist upward instead of letting your wrist lay more flat and natural. Anyway, the mouse looks cool and is smooth, but wasn't worth the new pain.",26-Jan-22

700,Amazon Customer,5,"This mouse was simple to set up in about 15 seconds: plug in the dongle, and turn on the mouse. It worked perfectly at that point. Looks like great quality. Scrolling was easy. Buttons work well. Resolution is on target, not too high and not too low. I like the USB-C recharging, hard to find in a product like this. This is great for a temporary office or on business trips, where portability is needed. It's lighter than I expected.",25-Jan-22
701,Xeyedjohn,5,I have been using most all of the Logitech mice for years.  This verified purchase was an upgrade from the MX Master 2S. I had been using that one on 2 home desktops and 1 work desktop.  This MX Master 3 is certainly an upgrade.  The magnetic metal scroll wheel and the USB C did it for me.  The button placements and the application functions were great too.  I just ordered a 2nd one.  3rd will not be long behind.,24-Jan-22

They are a dongle or Bluetooth connection and they can connect to up to three different computers including Apple Macs, or PC computers. This is great for me since I own both and these input devices seamlessly switch back and forth between the two platforms.The programmable mouse makes it really easy to individually program any of the buttons to perform proprietary functions for specific programs, whether they be CAD or video production.I would give this product 4.5 stars and would recommend these two products.The only drawback is there is no option for a double click and it would seem so simple to be able to add that optional function.",23-Jan-22
705,Girald,5,"I normally buy gaming mice for better resolution on my multi screen environment.. but they have lost quality over time... now it's not if the mouse will break but when..That said, the Logitech seem to be built better.. this one and my anywhere 2s is tough and doesn't break.. they are not ideal for gaming, but they are robust enough to outlive gaming mice",22-Jan-22
706,Landocat,1,"The scrolling on this is very unresponsive: any other mouse I've had, I can set it so a full stroke of the wheel scrolls about a page. With this, it goes one line at a time, so I have to spin the wheel many times to get the same effect as my old Logitech mouse. Neither the Logi Options and Options+ apps fix it, and no setting makes it work. Returning and buying the discontinued XM Master 2.",21-Jan-22
707,SnoRidge,3,Unfortunately the battery died and isn't holding a charge after only 1 year. It should last a lot longer than that.,20-Jan-22
708,Ryan F.,5,"First things first - I love this mouse. For the last 2 years, I've had 3 computers on my desk (2 MacBook Pro and 1 Windows Desktop). That means there were 3 keyboards and 3 mice on my desk at any one time. To say the least, my desk was a cluttered mess. I needed help, so I took the search to YouTube, where I eventually discovered this mouse, along with the MX KEYS keyboard.I must admit, I had my doubts. First, I was hooked on the Apple Magic Mouse. I used and abused the gestures, and I was a little apprehensive about giving them up for another mouse. I also felt there was a good possibility that Logitech was hyping this mouse up through paid promotions with content creators, which I suspect is happening. All those concerns went out the window after I started using the mouse.My favorite feature? Seamlessly switching between computers. After connecting the mouse to two separate computers, changing between them can be done with a simple push of a button. The connection is instantaneous, and there is absolutely no noticeable lag when switching between my two MacBooks. The same can be said for the MX KEYS keyboard, which I also love. Together, these products make a powerful duo that is a force to be reckoned with. Despite my reluctance, I have been converted. This mouse is great, and once you get used to it, you will not regret making the switch.",20-Jan-22

713,Britt Davis,2,Lack of replacement parts and a scroll wheel that breaks if you ever drop the mouse off your desk. (Being wireless that is likely to happen.) A low polling rate for the price.While this mouse is comfortable it misses in to many places. If Logitech actually supported the product then it would be great... Sadly they dont. Not only that but when you consider the price and the environmental concerns this is just future e-waste... Non reparable products are just unacceptable in these times.,17-Jan-22
714,Amazon Customer,1,"Despite its' premium pricing and purported cutting-edge technology, the Logitech MX Master 3 mouse bafflingly relies upon an antiquated USB-A Unifying Receiver for wireless connectivity. Since nearly all modern laptops use USB-C ports, users are forced to purchase an additional dongle to tote around with their laptop. This creates an extremely poor customer experience.In short, I'd advise against purchasing the Logitech MX Master 3 until Logitech finally updates it for compatibility with modern industry standards.",17-Jan-22

726,grx,4,"Bought this for the bluetooth connection to my work MacBook.  Yes - it will pair with the work machine, but I am unable to configure it due to our work firewall restrictions. Even so, it does the mouse basics - clicks, scrolls, etc. The thumb horizontal scrolls do not pair with the MacBook, but If I decide to use this on my home PC then it will come in handy.I was having issues with my thumb tendon getting sore after a full work day of using a $15 logitech mouse. The new mouse - because it is more of a palm mouse with the extra thumb support seems to have reduced the issue (less thumb pain).I took off one star because the ""fly wheel"" feature on the mouse only seems to work on some of the pages I work on. And even then it doesn't spin forever like some of the videos proclaim.All in all - this is a good ergonomic mouse for doing home office work. For gaming, I'd recommend going with a mouse specifically made for that.  For office tools and light design work, this seems to be more than enough of a match.",8-Jan-22
727,Bryan Selvey,5,"I absolutely love this mouse. Probably the best mouse I have ever owned. Only problem I’ve ran into is with scrolling while using this product wit MacOS.

I prefer a vertical mouse, but wanted to have the same option switching between devices with my mouse. So far not disappointed. Features are great and comfort is no issue so far. Using it for business mainly so no gaming experience to share. But lasts a good amount of time on a charge which makes this a winner.",4-Jan-22
731,Ty Nan Og,5,Nice upgrade over the mx master. I use a glorious wrist pad with it. Side scroller is awesome for productivity and gaming (when the game allows it). The vertical scroller is amazing and a big improvement over the original.Battery life is insane. For charging it upgradea from micro to usb-c which is convenient. Uses the same usb adapter by logitech.Worth getting if in your budget. Really hard to get big mice that feel good in a big person's hands.,4-Jan-22
732,Jonathan Torres,5,"I took the leap and got the MX Mouse. I LOVE it. I've had it for a few months now, and have only had to charge it once. I also went ahead and got the case for it and it's the best thing I could've done. I clip it to my bag and I ALWAYS have it with me. It connects to desktop, to my surface, and to my laptop. The ONLY complaint I have is that I wish the programming worked on my computer at work (without having to download Logi software - I have a government computer and they're strict). Also, to make it easier in the next model, the switching between devices button should be more accessible. It's not difficult to get it to it, but it could be easier to switch between my devices without having to flip over the mouse.",3-Jan-22

Right now it's mostly a guess when it's time to plug it in to charge.Pros: I know, I know... I just mentioned how the battery was a problem, but all things being equal the battery life is actually pretty darn good. Now, a qualifier, I do not use it for gaming. I use it for business and everyday browsing. Unfortunately, I haven't had the opportunity to use the multi-device select button on the base of the mouse. I am looking forward to using it, I just need to do a little more reading as to the hardware application method. So all in, it's actually a pretty darn nice device.

Because I like gadgets, I try new keyboards and mice often.  This is simply the best mouse I've ever used - and the only thing close was its predecessor version.  Things I love about it:  extraordinarily comfortable for someone with big hands (however, it's right-handed only); rechargeable battery and long battery life; its ability to track perfectly on surfaces that a traditional optical mouse would have difficulty with (like clear glass tables and shiny surfaces); the fact that I never need a mouse pad; great Bluetooth connection which obviates the need for the USB dongle (it comes with one, but you don't really need it); the Logitech Options software that lets you control literally every imaginable thing about the mouse, its buttons and behavior; and the smoothness of the scroll wheel between the left/right buttons (although I prefer to have ""SmartShift"" disabled).

743,Charles P.,3,"I like this mouse for what it is….I find it a pleasant and shapely fit for my hand that rests my palm and lets my thumb sit comfortably, the scroll wheel is responsive and spiffy, button feedback is great, and it has a nice glide. On its own design merits, I’ve really no complaints and would still be using this aside one major problem.<br>That being, after I began using it, my PC would randomly lock up and not awaken from my screensaver, and sometimes would even lock up in the midst of me doing some productivity for which I’d need to hard reboot my rig (and frustratingly, lose my progress). Oftentimes I would move the mouse after having not used my PC for a while to see no cursor response until about a second to two later, which indicates that it was sleeping and reawakening with new input. After much headache and freaking out believing this freezing was an issue with my hardware or OS, I began unplugging and trouble shooting all my external HDDs and peripherals. Nothing fixed it until I unplugged this mouse for another.Apparently this doesn’t appear to be a widespread issue, at least from what I can gather looking at the reviews and around the net, it just doesn’t jive with my PC, which is why I’m not giving it one star. I like it, I simply can’t use it.Just be aware….if your PC begins to freeze, this may be the culprit. Can’t imagine I’m alone with this issue.</br>",29-Dec-21

They put the switch button ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FRKN MOUSE! (see picture) You have to pick up the mouse, turn it over and press this little button with your other hand to get it to switch to the second computer! It couldn't be more inconvenient! Plus, to add insult to injury, this button's function cannot be mapped to a different button!  So much for using the Logitech Options software to move the function somewhere useful.  And NO, I do not want to use the Flows software as for security reasons I cannot download/install additional software on my company provided laptop!I found this problem out after having to call tech support in order to get the two unifying receivers setup properly for the two machines... for which of course there is no information ANYWHERE on how to do it correctly. What little documentation is available stinks... it is minimal and covers only the most basic setups.I told tech support about my disappointment and their lack of adequate documentation but there was no feeling of concern.

I'm glad that plenty of people find this mouse comfortable, and maybe you will too.  But for me, after just a short while using it, my hand and arm began to ache.  I gave it two days, but it just wasn't for me.  Comparing it to my old mouse, I realize that the slope where the palm is is much steeper than on typical mice, which meant my hand was kind of hovering over the back unless I pushed my hand way forward on the mouse, was was also uncomfortable. I wondered if I was doing something wrong but I found other users online with similar complaints.  I ended up returning it and getting a Logitech G703 instead, which had a similar form factor to my old mouse and was much more comfortable.

<span> I have to use a Windows PC for work but I also use my Mac for Reminders and other things. So, I always have both open. I had 2 keyboards and 2 mice and I would have to keep switching back and forth. It was confusing.  Got the MX Master 3 Mouse and MX Keyboard and Logitech Flow (included with the mouse) allows me to use the same keyboard and mouse seamlessly. I go to one edge of the screen and the mouse all of a sudden starts working on the other computer.  It's otherworldly. I can copy and paste text and files between the two. I know having to switch between your two bluetooth keyboards is first world problems, but this made my workflow SO much more efficient and I feel awesome every time the mouse switches to the other computer.Beyond that, the mouse is great. Very customizable, ergonomic, enough buttons and options to do just about anything.  I'm still blown away by the Flow software and it's functionality. It's been perfect. HIGHLY recommend for anyone working on a Mac and Windows machine and not enjoying their life.",21-Dec-21
762,JBZ76,5,"It almost goes without saying at this point, but I will say it anyway.. This is the Best Overall Mouse you can buy for 2021. The price is definitely worth it, especially if you pair it with the MX Master keyboard &amp; have 2 dongles to work with, because you can combine them and switch between multiple PC's &amp; bypass the Bluetooth option making the experience totally flawless. This mouse also let's you copy &amp; paste files from 1 PC to another which is a really cool feature. There isn't any reason I can think of to buy another mouse, unless you are a gamer &amp; only then are there better options. For everyone else, this mouse is as good as it gets.",21-Dec-21

772,Mike,3,I have both this mouse and the M720 model of the MX mice.  I love the M720 but I have no idea why the scrolling on this mouse is terrible.  It scrolls normal for a bit and then scrolls to 100x speed super quick it seams like in most apps.  Some it is impossible to scroll.  Google earth was impossible to use the mouse wheel.  I moved back to the M720 model.,16-Dec-21

774,Austin,2,"Let me start off by saying I purchased this coming from my MX Anywhere 2S for the ergonomics. I love the gesture button for easy navigation on my Macbook. Pairing it with bluetooth was fine but after that was it was a nightmare. I gave it two weeks, but it was awful.<br>This was the absolute worst tracking mouse I've used in 20+ years. The cursor was jumpy (to the point where it would give me a headache following it). When moving the mouse slowly, the cursor would jump/skip slightly. Increasing the speed would increase the distance the cursor would jump/skip. It didn't matter if I was using it on bluetooth or using the provided USB. I reset the NVRAM, did several restarts, changed my tracking settings, nothing fixed it.There also has to be some kind of built in acceleration, I've gone through all the settings and couldn't find anything, and I also disabled mouse acceleration on my system, yet, it still persists.</br>",15-Dec-21
775,jay,4,"I have used the previous version of this mouse for a long time and it has been by far my favorite mouse of all time, so much so that i would bring it everywhere with me despite its large size.  I bought the MX3 so that i could just keep my MX2 at the officePros:- ergonomic shape is good (but not as good as mx2)- can use bluetooth or a usb dongle to connect.- can easily switch between multiple connected computers- thumb wheel is great for photo/video editing and for spreadsheet scrolling- love the customization options for the fwd/back and thumb buttons!Cons:- $$$$- MX3 not as comfortable as previous versions and doesn’t add much new functionality (recommend you buy the much cheaper mx2)- DON’T BUY MAC ONLY VERSION- you can get all the same customizable features on the regular version and it comes with a dongle.- if ergonomics is your goal, get the vertical wrist version instead",14-Dec-21

780,Nate,5,"I was a bit hesitant at first because it looks a little funny and/or big, but having used it I now don't like using other mouses, even ones from logitech. Really full featured. My only complaint would be the momentum of the scroll wheel, but honestly that's pretty minor.",12-Dec-21

I don’t expect it works exactly as an Apple mice but still very disappointed.

The horizontal scroll wheel is seriously misplaced, requiring an awkward hand movement to place my thumb on the wheel. Also, the vertical scroll wheel worked only intermittently, and the overall feel of the mouse, while not uncomfortable, was somewhat bulky. I continue to prefer the much less expensive Logitech M705 mouse, which I've used for several years.",9-Dec-21

792,Kflan,2,"I have used the MX master 3 before and liked it so much I bought a second one for work. The mouse that I received has a strange issue with the scroll wheel that is very annoying. It has a ""bounce"" or ""reverb"" inside of it when scrolling on the click scroll setting. When scrolling at a medium speed, it will make a fairly loud bouncing noise and will vibrate in your hand. I believe this to be a manufactures defect as this bounce is not present in my other mouse.<br>This mouse has amazing functionality for productivity but I would not recommend it for gaming.</br>",6-Dec-21

794,Morgdalaine Y,1,"Logi Options and the Logi Options+ are absolute trash applications. The mouse constantly shows ""inactive"" in the applications which then renders the scroll wheel useless.

It honestly makes me never want to buy another Logi product ever again.",5-Dec-21

797,Russell,5,"I'm not a gamer, so I'll leave in-depth commentary on latency, programability, etc to those folks.But for something comfortable, with a long battery life and easy, well-placed programable buttons - there is nothing close (and I've gone through about 20 different models in the last few years).Other reviews go into depth - so I'll just say the two things that are absolute game-changers for my work are: - Speed scrolling - seriously, ever have scroll through documents/web pages that are about 2,000 lines long? That's routine for me. The ability to spin that wheel and watch the text literally fly by has been a huge time saver for me. - The top button just behind the scroll wheel. This is defaulted to 'free' the wheel to allow that speed scrolling. Click it and the wheel spins free. But if you spin it quickly, it switches from 'indents' that help control line-by-line scrolling to free-wheel anyway. So I programmed it to bring up the screen snipping tool in Windows 10. I have to document a LOT of screen shots in my work, so being able to quickly scroll to what I need, click this and draw a rectangle to copy to clipboard is phenomenal for my workflow.The USC-C plug for recharging is convenient and battery life, as stated, is excellent. About once a week I plug it in during lunch and have never even had a low battery warning pop up.",3-Dec-21
798,Craig R. Bode,4,"My wrist hurts less using this mouse, compared to using the Anywhere mouse.  It has a slight tilt for right handed people, and you can rest your hand on it.  A bit more tilt, making this a vertical mouse, would be a nice improvement.I have medium sized hands (medium sized gloves are a perfect fit), and this mouse is a bit too large for my hand.  I hold the mouse at a bit of an angle, so I can ""choke up"" on it to reach the clickers.  This mouse would be a bad fit for people with small hands (most women).  Obviously, this mouse was designed by men, for men with larger hands.Cat hair finds its way into the opening for the optical sensor causing poor mouse control until the hair is removed.  There are thin unsealed cracks between the parts surrounding this opening, and they provide ample opportunity for cat hair to lodge in it.  Unlike the Anywhere mouse, this mouse doesn't have a cover that easily comes off for when you need to remove the cat hair.My main complaint with this mouse is how easy cats are able to left and right click the mouse while you are using it.  The Anywhere mouse has a lip around the outer perimeter of the mouse keys, preventing this.  With the MX mouse if you slide the top into something (like your drink, or snacks) it will left click.  So when you move the mouse to keep the cat from clicking it you pull your hand away, the mouse hits something on your desk and it left clicks.  Of course, the pointer has moved above the X in the top right hand corner, and you have closed the program you were using.  If you don't pull the mouse away, the cat will bump it, causing a click, and we all know, cats know all the keyboard shortcuts and the worst places to click, so this is equally disastrous.",3-Dec-21
799,Matt,1,"The original Performance MX was the best mouse I have ever had. It fit my hand comfortably, I only had to charge it every other month and it lasted me 10 years even with a few beverages spilled on it. The MX master 3 just feels cheaper. Its too high on the rear left and too low on the front right. Its not horrible ergonomically but if I held it in my hand before I bought it I would have looked for other options. Based on ergonomics and functionality its a three star mouse. The price tag drops it to a 2. The privacy policy saying I need to agree to them collecting data on my contacts and relationships to install software for full functionality drops it to 1 star.",3-Dec-21

Let me tell you my experience has been nothing but excellent.I have a 2020 MBP 16"" with THREE devices connected via Bluetooth in my workflow: My Keychron K2 keyboard, Sony WH-1000MX4 headphones, and this mouse.

I no longer have to use my KVM switch to change machines to answer calls and my CAD shortcuts that I programmed into my mouse work identically on both machines.  I also got the MX keys keyboard so when I Flow from one machine to the next, the keyboard comes along.  I can also copy and paste from one machine to the other.  Unbelievable!  This is more than I expected.  Highly recommend.  Don't worry about scroll wheel speed.  It is not super fast all of the time.  That is a choice.  It is super precise for me.",28-Nov-21
807,BlaST,1,"I'm not sure if I got a defective unit or what but this mouse has been a major disappointment. I've had multiple issues right out of the box and I've tried multiple things to fix these issues to no avail.  - I've tried moving the receiving closer to the mouse.  - I've tried using bluetooth.  - I've tried reinstalling drivers.  - I've tried restarting my computer.  - I've tried plugging the mouse into the computer via the cable.  - I've tried using this mouse on two different computers with different operating systems.PROS:Really comfortable and esthetically pleasing.CONS:The Scroll Wheel.  Scrolling in general on this mouse is terrible.  1.) Even if you fix the scroll wheel to ratchet, the scroll wheel will go into freespin with moderate force. I tried going into the Logitech Options and manually setting it to ratchet and it still does it.  2.) Scrolling feels very inconsistent. On my other mice, each ratchet click has a set distance making scrolling consistent and predictable. I've tried going into the Logitech Options and disabling smart shift and smooth scrolling but that didn't fix it. Changing the sensitivity didn't fix it either.Thumb wheel  1.) There's a threshold on thumb wheel scrolling? I don't understand it. Thought it had to be a sensitivity problem but that wasn't it. I have to move the thumb wheel a certain amount and at a certain speed before it responds. The whole reason why I bought this mouse was for video editing. I want to use the thumb wheel to move the timeline precisely. What's the point if it doesn't recognize subtle inputs?Connectivity  1.) The mouse pointer is not smooth at all. Sometimes it freezes or lags. It feels really choppy. It's incredible inconsistent and I don't understand why. I've tried all the things I listed at the beginning of this review and nothing has fixed it.  2.) The computer doesn't automatically recognize the mouse when you plug in the receiver and turn on the mouse. I have to open up Logitech Options before it recognizes it. I've bought $20 mice that have preformed better than this.Conclusion: I've been a huge fan of logitech ever since I bought the first generation G9 mouse a decade ago. Maybe there's something I'm missing? Maybe I have a defective unit? Whatever it is, it's been really disappointing.",28-Nov-21

813,Marc M.,5,"I was not disappointed when I took a chance on this mouse. Although it may take a bit to get used to a new shape that is a little larger in your hands this mouse is quickly growing on me with it's multiple programmable features. The scroll wheel is on another level as it was designed for that need for scrolling down long lists, social media or any other time you need to quickly scroll down a page. This mouse can switch from 3 different devices on the fly. It comes with an app that allows you to customize the functions, check the battery life and can even recognize other Logitech devices you may have connected to the same computer. Awesome mouse!",24-Nov-21
814,Amy,1,I have wanted this mouse for a long time. I see how beneficial it is for design and productivity. Everyone online raves about it. I've bought cheap Logitech mice before so why not? So I decided to get one. The problem? It doesn't do the thing that makes it good for productivity.  I can't save the the buttons doing different things on different apps on the Logitech app. I've tried contacting their support and I am still trying to figure it out with them three weeks later.  Worst part is they won't give me a refund or a replacement until the upper level support says too. Even though it's been going on for three weeks. And for one week they have responded back. This is ridiculous and I am frustrated with Logitechs support. I never plan on buying another Logitech product from them again.,23-Nov-21

The button on the thumb rest is extremely annoying to the point that the only way to make the mouse actually usable for me was to remove that button (because you can't disable it from the Logitech app, it always will disable mouse movement when pushed). The main scroll wheel is a nightmare that well scroll pass everything unless you stop it, and even if you disable it in the options it will still do it from time to time.

I normally bought all my corded mice from Logitech, so it was given I would use them to try this out.  It really is such a nice mouse.  It's a pleasure to use.

Precise tracking on any surface and ultrafast scrolling, this mouse will Optimize your workflow, whether your working with Windows Office or with Adobe Creative Cloud or other editing software. your able to connect to three devices. The LogiOptions app allows you to custom set the buttons &amp; scrolls. It is Compatible with Mac and Windows. Battery life is incredible, Charges via USB-C. I highly recommend to pair with the ""Logitech Craft Advanced Wireless Keyboard"". I enjoy this combo so much i bought the same mouse &amp; Keyboard for my desk at work.",10-Nov-21
828,schoolie,3,"I have a mx master original mouse. The original feels great in my hand. I bought the mx master 3 as a replacement. The mx master 3 is way smaller and is actually hurting my hand/wrist to use. I wish it was the original size. I'm 5-8"", 200lb., and wear a 10.5 shoe. It is very nice, just too small. I can't use it",10-Nov-21
829,Michael,1,"This  mouse worked great for about 10 months of very light use. I used the mouse to complete my online college assignments during the school year and not so much in the summer. It was very accurate and performed smoothly but completely stopped working this fall after a month of use. I thought it just needed charging but I plugged it in nothing happened. I left it plugged in overnight and no results, after trying two other cables and other sources with no change, I contacted support. I gave the customer service agent all the information and after she found out I was using the mouse for personal use and not business, she transferred me to another agent who asked all the same questions and troubleshooting steps the other agent asked.. I sent all the information she asked for additionally like a photo of the mouse with ticket number, serial number from the mouse and not the package, all my contact information including phone number and where and when I purchased the item. Today she sends me an email asking for the same thing. I paid almost a hundred bucks for this crap. Logitech will not get my money ever again and I have a few of their products in my home. Stay away from this mouse unless you want to waste money!!!",9-Nov-21
830,Jo,4,"I like the mouse especially the horizontal scrolling, I have to charge it weekly or it might stop working midway. Overall its pretty good.",9-Nov-21
831,Rus Cordova,5,I love this mouse! It makes like so much easier and it more comfortable than any mouse I’ve ever used! I bought the keyboard too because of its awesomeness.,8-Nov-21
832,Suprateem B.,3,"This is one of the most acclaimed mice out there. Features like Ultrafast Scrolling and Vertical scroll make this a very productivity centric tool for professionals. However, on my desk setup, which is a M1 Max Macbook Pro 16 with 64gb Memory connected to a hub which drives the mouse, a Keyboard and a 4K monitor, the Bluetooth latency is just too high. There is no option for a wired connection. You can either use the native Bluetooth pairing which is more unreliable, or via the dongle provided which improved latency to an extent but not much. The difference in overall experience is very apparent when I use the laptop by itself, the mouse movement is simply SO much better. Didn't expect this issue from this mouse, but overall everything else is 10/10.",7-Nov-21
833,Kevin Geary,5,Is it a mouse? Is it a cylon fighter? This thing looks a little strange but it's the best mouse I've ever used. I never thought I'd want to spend a lot on a mouse but I needed something more ergonomic. I tried the Logitech vertical mouse but I found that this one was more comfortable. Worked great right out of the box. And USB C is the icing on the cake.,7-Nov-21
834,Sham,1,I will keep this review short and simple.<br>I had mx vertical mouse. Due to the less feature like side scroll and hyper scroll i tried to use this one though mc vertical is one of the best ergonomic mouse out there.<br>Pros :- Has better grip.- Good placement of forward and backward button and easy to access it unlike mx vertical.- Button click is really tactile and smooth.- multi device feature is great best part of most logitech devices.Cons:- Biggest complaint of this mouse which makes this mouse useless is scroll. You will find many article and complain about this mouse on reddits.Mouse scroll most of the time act wired some it lags and freeze and do not react on scroll Very buggy and will drive you crazy about this.I have used many mouse in past even cheaper mouse like $15 has very very good accuracy.- I have asked to logitech support team for help.Being all the feature and build quality due to lack of accuracy in scroll I will definitely will not recommend. Since this mouse is not cheap. Cheaper mouse does much much better than this.** DO NOT GO WITH THE HYPE**Look for scroll issue about this mouse online and you will find so many complaints and logitech did not solve it  with the new release.</br></br>,6-Nov-21
835,AJ Mac,3,"As many have noted this a very nice mouse. However, not sure if it is an Apple issue or a Logitech issue but scrolling and tracking are terrible on the Mac with this mouse. No easy fix that works. Many times the scrolling will not work in documents and webpages despite noted ""fixes"". Also, moving the mouse across the screen is often a challenge. Maybe the new ""beta"" software updates will work but these have been problems for well over a year, come on Logitech, fix these issues.As an aside, the keyboard works great without issues.",6-Nov-21
836,Dennis,5,I have been using the Logitech MX master mouse for several years.  I tend to wear out the switches as I do a lot of mousing and very little keyboarding (job related). This time I upgraded to the version 3 mouse and was not disappointed.,6-Nov-21

839,T. Hollins,5,You don't know what you're missing in a mouse until you get this device. I'm a Logitech 705 guy. Bought 705s for my workers and my home PCs.This one blows it away. Its smooth in every respect. No stress on your hand at all. It matches the curvature of your hand without getting in the way. I'm sure you've tried those other type of mice.It is smoother than anything I've ever used. I use it on world of warships and its just fine. My son said it might not keep up with the massively fast games. I dunno since I don't have time to play those.I recommend the purchase.,5-Nov-21
840,Bernardo ,3,"I like the ergonomic design, it fits in my hand nicely. One thing i did not like was the fact that this product would often disconnect or stutter while in use. It happened pretty often in my day to day use and got really annoying.",3-Nov-21

<span> It's too big to move the mouse. and price expensive. Not recommend.",1-Nov-21
842,Owen,3,"For 100 bucks you would think Logitech would include a dongle dock on the device, it does not. THe thumb rest has a hidden button, thats neat, but not needed. The mouse is weighty which feels good, but is a bit lower profile than most standard mouses, this takes away from the ergonomic design since you have to flatten your hand more to hold the mouse. Finally, the dpi button does not seem to work at all.IMO not worth the cost, over priced flashy design sacrificed too much function for fashion.",1-Nov-21
843,Mike,5,This is THE most comfortable mouse I’ve ever used and I have been using computer mice for 30 years. If you want comfort do not hesitate to purchase this mouse.,1-Nov-21
844,Adam White,5,"Update: I have enabled the FLOW function on the mouse to bounce back and forth between my laptop and desktop. I am floored by how well this works. No extra button presses, no fancy setup. I'm going to order a MX Keys keyboard now to further take advantage of this feature. Makes my desk and use of 2 computers so much more streamlined!I spent 19 years as a graphic designer, and always used whatever mouse that came with the mac workstations I had. Upon entering the Civil Engineering world, I splurged and purchased the MX Master 3 and oh man, I am so glad I did. The scroll wheel (with ratchet turned off) is so nicely weighted and smooth, and the buttons all fall under my fingers perfectly. I've mapped some of the buttons to specific keystrokes in Autocad to make my workflow faster and it has definitely helped. The battery life is great, giving me about 2 weeks of solid use before I need to plug in the USB C cable for an overnight charge. You can also use this mouse when it is plugged in and charging if you need to. I had no issues pairing it with a new Lenovo laptop and getting straight to work. Get this if you can afford it. I'm glad I did.",31-Oct-21
845,Larry Peck,5,"Great product... Love the features, the fit and the quality. My favorite is the free spinning flywheel weighted scroll wheel... Awesome!",29-Oct-21

847,Amazon Customer,1,"I'm an iOS Developer and bought this mouse for work use with my MacBook Pro.Its a mess, they shouldn't even be calling it compatible.First of all, it's been what - 5 years or more - and Logitech still could not possibly care less about a USBC adapter for MacBooks. I have to use a dongle or dock depending on where I am working, and it sucks.Second, I usually need my MacBook on my left of my monitors, because I am right handed, so mouse, coffee, headphones, notebook etc are on the right hand side of my desk. Even this separation between mouse and receiver  (or bluetooth, which is worse) on occasion will cause dropouts.But the biggest problem is that when my MacBook is working hard - on XCode compiles. or loading storyboards - the mouse just floats around undetached from my movements until the CPU calms down - its is INFURIATING for a mouse this expensive on a quad-core MacBookPro with 16 GB RAM.Just dont buy it - this mouse isnt that special, its ergonomic, has back and forward buttons, a scroll wheel - big deal, most mice do. Its not reliable, its not performant, it not worth buying for Mac.",29-Oct-21
848,John S Gorny,4,"Thought id like the sidescroller more than i actually do, also the magwheel tends to be finicky, but it works. (When you scroll fast it lets go of magnetic stubbliness)Side scroll is awkward to use, wish that wasnt smooth scrolling as i accidentally hit from time to time.Nice premium device, i thought it would greatly improve my productivity, but so far it hasnt really.Nice enough not to return since old mouse was old, but if i had to do it again id just get the other mouse from mk850 kit, whatever that one is called. Scroll wheel is metallic and mechanically switchable from smooth to stubbly.",28-Oct-21
849,Fatih Uludag,1,"I am a remote worker and I use this mouse every day. It has been one and a half year since I purchased it. Its skin recently started to wear out. Please check the pics.

854,Amazon Customer,3,"Pros:<br>1. Comfortable design that fits well.2. USB-C Charging + works while chargingCons:The two main things I bought this mouse for actually ended up being the most disappointing parts.1. The horizontal scroll wheel is almost un-usable due to lack of application support. The applications that do support it scroll so slowly that it is faster to just use the mouse point on the scroll bar.2. The button to swap between devices is located on the bottom of the mouse. This means you have to lift the mouse, flip it over to press the button. Since I am working from home I am constantly swapping between my personal and work computer. I've resulted to just using two mice instead of utilizing the multi-device option because it is considerably faster. I don't understand why this can't be mapped with the gesture button which would be perfect, but alas no go. I would have prefered to get 2 M720 triathlons which have the devices selection button next to the thumb rest than have this mouse.</br>",26-Oct-21

865,The Exacting Consumer,5,"Productivity is great with this mouse but you already knew that. You've seen countless reviews and youtube videos saying how the MX Master 3 is ""absolutely NOT for gaming"" which is all 100% based on the DPI. As a FPS/ platformer/ RPG gamer who owns probably a dozen wired gaming mice and a 240Hz 49"" G9, I feel they couldn't be more wrong.Yes the MM3 tops out at 4000 DPI vs the 16K or 25K on some of the other units, but it really doesn't matter. Have you ever tried to game using a mouse set at 16K+ DPI? It's crazy, the slightest touch rockets your reticle or camera from one end of the viewable area to the other, it's dizzying and frankly unenjoyable! Matter of fact, I have actually been turning DOWN the max DPI on my gaming mice for this exact reason. If you need crazy high DPI to comfortably game, God bless, I don't and doubt most do. I'm playing FarCry 6 right now on PC @ 4K DPI and the experience is fantastic. No lag, plenty of camera speed and reaction time is exactly what I need. If you've been on the fence for buying this one due to the bad gaming reviews, try it anyway, you can always return.A few other items of note... Construction is good as you would expect altho I find that the rubbery plastic material can get a little sweaty in the hand sometimes. It is a large mouse which won't be for everyone but fits my hand fine. Scroll wheels are excellent altho the side scroll rarely works, many apps just ignore it. Being able to just SPIN the middle wheel or ratchet slowly without having to push a switch button is pretty slick and here you can still change the default behavior with an available switch button. The primary buttons feel good and respond well but are super clicky, bordering on obnoxiously loud. The Logitech Options software is simple and powerful allowing full customization for any app you choose which is powerful and unique! You don't have to load or switch a full profile that remaps all your buttons based on a single game or app, it just context switches based on the app you're in at the moment. Nice! The downside is that this model doesn't have onboard memory so any customizations come through the software. But, you can cloud sync your settings so if you move your mouse between devices (which can be done via bluetooth or wireless receiver), your settings will follow you. Finally the battery life is amazing. Weeks on a charge and it still works fine when plugged in to top up via USB-C. My only complaint here is that you have to open the app to see where your battery level is, the light on the mouse only lights from waking after being left idle. And then, the app only gives you low/ medium/ high which isn't great. Gripes aside, this is my first non-gaming, non-wired mouse in a very long time and I love it.Pros:-Construction quality is excellent, shape, wheels, buttons, thumb shelf/ button-""Intelligent"" scroll wheel that both spins and ratchets depending how hard you flick-Incredible battery life, mouse stays active while charging-Bluetooth (3 devices via button on bottom) or Receiver connections-Per app customization, not just bulk profile based like others-Cloud sync via app to easily retrieve configs on different devices-4K DPI is plenty for most gamersCons:-Rubbery plastic coating gets a little sweaty-Loud very clicky primary buttons-Large, probably not great for smaller hands-No on-board memory, all configs via software-Battery level only readable via app and even then isn't exactMy rig:i7-9700K (water)32GB RAMNVME SSDs2080TIG9",19-Oct-21

869,Carl Underwood,5,"Performs excellent. Slides around on my desk silky smooth. Great free-spinning scroll wheel (I already had that on my Performance MX mouse). They claim ""up to 70 days"" battery life, but mine is showing low after just 2-1/2 weeks. Although, I use the mouse many hours/day, so I suppose that's not too bad.But, there are a couple things I like better on my old Performance MX mouse -- 1) It fit my hand better. 2) The left &amp; right buttons began way back at the center of the mouse, making them easier to click on even when I was using my fingertips to move the mouse around. (I know that one sounds strange, but sometimes I don't want the mouse seated all the way back into the palm of my hand. If I use my fingertips, I don't have to move my entire forearm, I just need to flex my fingers to move the pointer.)______________________________________12-06-2021 UPDATE:I've gotten really used to how this mouse feels. Now I like it better than my old Performance MX mouse. Go figure. I guess it's what you get accustomed to. If you're on the fence about upgrading, just do it, and your 'muscle memory' will adjust.Also, an update on battery life. I had to charge it today, and the last time I charged it was on 10-21-2021 (46 days ago). So, that's just over a 1.5 months. I can live with that. I use this mouse about 10-16 hours/day.",14-Oct-21

873,Matt,5,"*Update* It works just fine with the MacBook. I use a USB hub and it seemed to only act up when the Logitech MX Keys keyboard was being used as well. It could have also been when my external hard drive is also plugged into the hub. Basically, what the just the mouse dongle plugged into the hub, everything has worked great so I've upped my rating to 5.This worked beautifully with my old PC. I switched to a MacBook Air M1 and have had nothing but problems, yet for some reason I keep using it. It stutters constantly, lags, loses connection, etc. Same with the keyboard, but the keyboard has been more reliable overall. The scroll wheel is definitely a cool feature. The mouse buttons are a little light, so I'd accidentally right click on things that I didn't mean to. This required me to adjust my grip a little and haven't had many issues since.",11-Oct-21

So I had to re program the back/forward buttons to flip through tabs in excel quickly.Also, the sideways scroll in excel is BACKWARD from what you may think.  Or at least how I think it should be.

It connects to my MacBook Pro almost as soon as I turn on the mouse on. One thing I love about this mouse is that it doesn’t need a hard surface for it to work properly.

The ergonomic design is worse than G903 for me. The mouse is too heavy to lift. The right side doesn't curl inward so that my index finger has to stack with my little finger.

891,V. Matthews,4,"Pretty good mouse. I have been with the series since Performance Mouse MX. This mouse has a great quality feel - sturdy yet soft to the touch.Tracking is exceptional on all surfaces whether bumpy or clear. You don’t need a mouse pad. I barely need to charge it — maybe once a month.The only complaint that I have is the scroll wheel is has textured metal ridges that will probably hurt your finger. Luckily my finger has gotten used to it after a week or so but we should have to callous  over for a product.Every thing else is great, no regrets.",25-Sep-21

894,Kapil,4,This is one of the best mouse I have ever used the designers so ergonomic and doesn’t hurt my wrist at all. upper Scroll wheel is so smooth but The side scroll wheel is not as good as a top one. Battery life is amazing It took like an hour to charge complete. The only drawback is the button in the bottom of the mouse to switch to different connections you should have placed it on top instead of the bottom because if I want to change I had to lift the mouse rotate it and change the connection but it would be really nice if they placed it on the top instead.,21-Sep-21

896,Greg Collins,5,"I have heard a lot about the MX Master series over the years and I finally went for it- a great decision. This is the best mouse I have ever used. It easily connects to 3 computers via Bluetooth and switches back and forth with ease. I have it connected to a MacBook Pro, Lenovo ThinkPad, and a HP Chromebook and it handles all 3 without issue. I would highly recommend for anyone that does a lot of computer work. My hand never gets tired.",21-Sep-21
897,Amazon Customer,5,I've been buying MX masters for many years and this new model has one feature that is noticeably better than the last generation.  The scroll wheel lock/unlock is quiet.  The previous one made a loud noise whenever it locked or unlocked. The lateral scroll wheel is bigger and easier to use and the side buttons make more sense.  The previous gen was bigger which I preferred but I'm getting used to this one. The MX master is a deluxe mouse you won't regret buying.,21-Sep-21
898,SeasonedAmazonShopper,5,"I use this mouse on my WFH setup, and it replaced my basic Logitech mouse.  I'm a developer so I use my mouse and keyboard a lot, and I've been working a lot.

This mouse seems to have helped eliminate my wrist discomfort now that my hand sits more naturally.  I also like the way the product material feels in my hand.  It just feels good.",20-Sep-21
899,Keogh,4,"It is a nice, smooth mouse with great features, but I have to change from the ergo grip to get the buttons right.

900,Dennis Dow,4,"This is how big mice should be. This makes conventional mice feel like toys.  The ability to switch the wheel from ratchet mode to free spin is great.  It also tracks better than any mouse I have used.For the price, I am somewhat disappointed.  I have (still) a Logic G13 and have every single button programmed and used.  I have a G710+ with every programmable button programmed and used.  There is no such capability in this mouse.  Of all companies, Logitec should know their customers want that capability.  I would suspect that customers who want to program the thumb buttons and wheel out-number the customers who want to use the same mouse automatically on 2 computers by 10 to 1.  So we have a relatively useless feature but not a helpful one.  This can be fixed and I hope they wake up to the issue.You get a great mouse, but it isn't Logitec smart, but",20-Sep-21
901,RW,4,"I love the feel of this mouse! I wish I had purchased it long ago. I subtracted one star in my rating because the battery life is a bit short. Also, I starting having Excel issues after installing the mouse (not as responsive, especially when saving a file).",19-Sep-21
902,E. Hu,5,"It is a pretty good mouse especially with the ability to modify some buttons when the Logitech app is installed. It's quite heavy though, but it's good for folks who like heavier mouses and I think gamers like heavier mouses.",19-Sep-21
903,Panda416,1,Hate the feel of this mouse. MX Master 2 is a much better mouse. Skip this garbage and get the previous gen of this mouse.,18-Sep-21
904,Raul,5,Plug and play with optional presets for popular apps. Overall great mouse and super comfortable to use for hours.,17-Sep-21
905,Bergsy,4,"The only negative I've found is the price.  You can buy a good mouse for less.I've had it only for two days; haven't even customized it yet.  Seems to be a super mouse; very easy to use.  I like especially that it doesn't require a lot of color variation in a pad; in fact it doesn't require a pad!Main reason I'm writing is to make clear what might not be obvious.  Both this mouse and the MX Keys come with a dongle.  Neither dongle works with both devices, and my Windows 10 computer won't accept two dongles.  This had me stumped for a while till I accepted that I could connect one device with wireless and the other with bluetooth.  (An Amazon chat person, after considerable chatting with me and waits for him to get more expert help, finally did suggest this, but I wasted a bit more time trying to find a one-dongle-for-both solution.)  You just have to use the three-connection option on both devices.  In fact I'm now using bluetooth to connect them both, which so far (about two hours) works perfectly.  So, this may have been obvious to many folks more proficient than I (a low bar) but I figured it's worth a post to make it clear.",16-Sep-21
906,B'rett,5,Works really well for my hand. Software is pretty slick too. It's high quality stuff you'd expect from Logitech nowadays.,16-Sep-21
907,amy lindsey,5,Having customized application settings via Logitech options is a nice feature.  Being able to Mute Zoom or Teams calls with the back button makes it easier to control presence in the call.

<span> I used to love this mouse, but after just a year it now stutters every few seconds making it nearly unusable. Extremely disappointed.",15-Sep-21
909,btsbarton,4,"I purchased this mouse for professional use; after seeing pictures of it on Reddit, and then reading tons of positive reviews. I had been using gaming-style mice previously. This mouse looks very professional and is designed for power users. My use case is primarily Solidworks, Adobe Acrobat, MS excel &amp; word, and Microsoft Dynamics GP; and am in front of the computer 6-8 hours a day typically so I want a mouse that is comfortable and efficient.Ergonomically, I find the mouse to be fairly comfortable, but not perfect. I have Smedium hand size, and my mouse grip is something between claw and palm grip. My pinky is a bit uncomfortable so far, but I am still getting adjusted to the new mouse. I have found my thumb reaching too far back and high for the ""back"" button, but again, i think this is just a matter of getting used to the mouse. The gesture button (on thumb rest) is a bit tricky/awkward to click, and I dont think I will really use the gesture feature so i programmed this button to toggle the scroll wheel between ratchet and freespin mode. The mouse has a nice rubberized texture, but Im sure this will wear in time...we will see. It has a good weight too it, feels solid, but some people may prefer lighterweight mice.The buttons are nice and clicky, good tactile and audible feedback. 7 total buttons. It has the two primary mouse buttons, the scroll wheel can be clicked, a small button directly behind the scroll wheel, two buttons on the side of the mouse (forward, back), and then a button on the bottom edge of the thumb rest.Alright can we talk about the main scroll wheel now? Im obsessed with this wheel. First, it looks awesome. No plastic, 100% Machined steel. Second, it scrolls like nothing else Ive ever experienced. I leave it in ""ratchet"" mode most of the time, but it can also switch to free-spin. In ratchet mode, if you flick it, it will freespin. And with the Logitech Options software you can dial it in to be just how you like it. Electromagnets, Baby! I find myself just flicking the wheel sometimes because it feels so nice.All of the buttons are fully customizable using the Logitech Options software, and can have specific functions depending on what app you are in. The downside, is if your work computer is locked down by the company and you cant install this software, I think you will be stuck with the default functions which may not be enjoyable (in particular I found the default pointer speed way too slow).This mouse can connect to your computer via bluetooth or the Logitech Unity USB dongle, and can be paired with up to 3 computers (toggle between them using the button  on the bottom of the mouse).I ordered the mouse in ""Graphite"" which is the dark but definitely not black. It would be nice if they offered a color that is a darker, more true ""black."" Still, its a nice looking mouse, especially with the shiny steel scroll wheel.",15-Sep-21
910,Steve K,2,The mouse was expected to be a positive purchase but the software has never worked properly even with the latest software update  (9.20.374; installed 2021-09-14). The user is supposed to be able to assign actions or keystrokes to each of the buttons for any installed applications. This doesn't work at all. I've specifically assigned keystrokes for buttons that apply to multiple applications and they don't work. The mouse is far too expensive to be dealing with this nonsense. I've written LogiTech before and have received no help at all.,15-Sep-21
911,David H. Hollister,5,I've used many mice over the decades.  This is now my #1 choice and I'll never use another.  Just spend the money already so you can enjoy it.,14-Sep-21
912,Dave,2,"The mouse was great for the first couple months but then after a firmware update the mouse cursor sometimes gets stuck for 5-10 seconds before it starts moving again. Oddly enough it only happens on random days but when it happens it is extremely annoying to deal with. This will be my first and last Logitech mx mouse I will ever buy. Unacceptable and I'm already way past my refund window so SOL. I've already googled all the various ""fixes"" some websites have suggested and watched enough youtube videos, tried them all and I can confidently confirm that THERE IS NO FIX",14-Sep-21

916,Mike Mackintosh,3,"I liked this mouse but had to return it. It was comfortable under my hand but I did not like the fact it did not have a DPI switcher, my pinky would drag on it’s side and it was too light weight wise. Otherwise the scrolling and the button clicking was awesome. It worked great in this like photoshop and editing but once I jumped into a game, I felt the drawback.",11-Sep-21
917,Tri Le,1,"This is the worst quality mouse I've ever used. After 10 months the wheel loss the ratchet function, so now it  only go freely, I've already change the setting to setting but its not working. Send me the replacement.",11-Sep-21
918,JT McGuire,5,"$100 is expensive for a computer mouse. But damn, this device is worth every penny. The attention to detail from Logitech's engineers and product designers is evident with every piece of this mouse. The overall design is excellent, as this thing is the most comfortable mouse I've ever used. Every button is in an easily accessible position. Everything is customizable through a surprisingly slick piece of software that runs equally as well on my macbook or my windows desktop. The entire user experience has been considered and tuned on a system level, which is not an easy thing to do in product design.The scroll wheel is just awesome. There is nothing else like it on the market, to my knowledge. It ratchets when you want, but scrolls hundreds of lines smoothly with a flick. It's controlled actively with a clever electromagnetic mechanism to flip the ratchet on and off. It's taking advantage of magnetic hysteresis to alter the field produced by a magnetic core, which interacts with the toothed steel scroll wheel depending on the polarity of the last current spike. It works a lot like the magnetic core memory in really old computers to store and flip states. Very cool. I hope the engineer who came up with this got a raise.The side scroll wheel is very useful too and is mechanically damped with a premium feel. The forward and back buttons have a tactile click, and the modifier button beneath your thumb allows you to program a range of extra functions with gestures, which is a nice touch.Overall, you can't go wrong with this thing. I recommend buying it if you want it at all. It'll be hard to use anything else after using it for a few days.",10-Sep-21
919,Jawdat A.,3,"I think this mouse is excellent and has some really good features. However, as a graphic designer, I think the gestures on the Apple Magic Mouse are much more convenient.Would recommend for anyone except designers",10-Sep-21
920,Joe,1,The scrolling issue kills this product. I purchased it 6 month ago and heavily use it on daily basis since then. This mouse decides to zoom or scroll  pages by itself. I personally giving up here...,10-Sep-21
921,Amazon Customer,5,"Battery dies and there is little instruction.  But charges fine, using supplied cord. Comfortable!",9-Sep-21
922,Edward K.,2,"I had high expectations for this mouse given the high price point and Logitech's reputation. However, even on its 3rd iteration, Logitech has failed to put together a decent scroll wheel.They market the magnetic scroll wheel as if it's an upgrade, but it's not. I'd use a scroll wheel on a $10 mouse any day of the week. The mouse has two options, regular scroll and infinite scroll.Regular scroll doesn't register the scroll about half the time and is very unreliable. Infinite scroll works much better than regular scroll, but when in infinite scroll, I can feel the scroll wheel loosen up and shift around whenever I move my mouse left to right. This is extremely annoying.When using a good mouse, you forget you're even using it. It should just feel like an extension of your hand. Instead, the MX Master 3 doesn't let you forget you're using a subpar product.Pretty disappointed that issues like this persist on its flagship productivity mouse. I'm a fan of the G915 keyboard and G602 mouse, but the MX Master 3 falls way behind the mark and I'm disappointed as a fan of their products.",7-Sep-21
923,John A. Young,5,This is the best investment that I have made into increasing my productivity. I highly recommend turning almost all of the buttons into gesture buttons so that you can add an extra 4 custom commands to them.The mouse feels amazing to use and definitely improves the experience of using my computer.,7-Sep-21
924,Dusty Dino,5,"I would say this is primarily for the power user that wants good ergonomics, lots of buttons, and lots of customization. Logitech delivers on all these fronts.First off, the ergonomics are quite good (Sorry, right-handed only). It's not just that the mouse is comfortable to use, but that the button placement is just on-point. The side-wheel, side-buttons, and gesture button are all easily accessible to the thumb, without having to make any awkward reaches. The left/right-buttons, and middle-buttons are similarly easy to access with your pointer or middle finger. The button and wheel feel is great. The middle-wheel is amazing. This mouse has just an all around good feel, in that it's comfortable, but also feels like you're using a quality tool. No complaints.There are a few options for connectivity. You can connect using the included Unifying receiver (my preference). Or you can connect via Bluetooth, if your computer has a Bluetooth adapter. Or you can connect using the included USB-A to USB-C charge cable. About the charge cable, yes, this mouse has rechargeable batteries sealed inside. I get about 3 months of light to medium usage between charges. It's not as good as the ~2 years that a AA powered mouse will get you these days. However, the mouse will work while charging, and you'll never get caught without batteries on-hand. Also, big kudos to Logitech for making the charging port USB-C.Customizations are not lacking. For each button, except left and right (which you can only swap), you have plenty of choices through the Logitech Options software. Also controllable are the standard things like scroll speed/direction (for both wheels), pointer speed, smoothness. The middle-wheel is probably one of the main ""physical"" attractions of this mouse. According to Logitech it floats on magnets. It can be configured to spin freely, and I mean freely. It's extremely smooth, has negligible resistance, and continues to spin for a long, long time after you flick the wheel. Or it can be configured to have the traditional ratchet feel. Or it can be configured to have a combination, where it ratchets when you go slowly, but spins freely when you give it a quick flick. The middle-wheel is really, really good.Button customizations and point/scroll customizations can be split in to two categories, global and application specific. This means that you can have customizations for the general system, but also customizations only for specific applications. For example, if you wanted the scroll speed to be slower when working in Acrobat, but faster when working in the Chrome browser, you can set these customizations and the mouse will automatically behave accordingly while working in those applications. This is just a basic example, but you actually have the full set of button assignments, as well as point and scroll options for each application. You can get very creative and really customize the mouse to work for you. You can even configure the middle-wheel to click in one application, but spin freely in another application. This level of customization is truly fantastic, and what sets this mouse apart as THE choice for professionals that work with pro software applications for a living.This mouse has the ability to pair to three computers. On the bottom of the mouse is a button that allows you to manually toggle between 1, 2, &amp; 3. However, Logitech Options allows you to take it a step further. If you have the mouse paired to your computers, and each computer has Options installed, then you can setup a feature called Flow. Flow allows you to drag your mouse to the edge of your screen, and it will automatically connect to your other computer. The cursor moves over to the screen of your other computer. Since I'm also using the MX Keys keyboard, it also transfers over to my other computer. Part of Flow is the ability to file share between the computers (requires them to be on the same Wi-Fi or Ethernet network). There are other options for a multi-device mouse, but this is a very seamless way to have the mouse switch devices. Unfortunately, if you don't like using Flow, you'll have to turn the mouse over and click the button to switch devices.My one complaint with this mouse is that of all the customizations, I can't seem to program a mouse button to lock my screen when I click it. There's a few ways to lock a screen, but my preference is to click the middle-wheel. It's no biggie, but it just seems like an oversight with all the other available customizations. I still highly recommend this mouse to power users and professionals that work in pro software applications. This is by far the best mouse I have ever owned. It's a bit costly, but worth every penny.",5-Sep-21
925,markb,5,Scrolling on the mac machines is a little wonky with this - when I have a document and you fast scroll on the page- and move over to another document - it will finish scrolling on your other document - tried the different speeds and such - but not like mac mouse where scrolling is perfect - very rough feeling to make sure I am stopped scrolling on one doc- to work on anotherVery large to work with- but comfortable - I do like it in a way - not bad,4-Sep-21

931,Dr. RosenRosen,5,"Aside from my old Kensington 12-button trackball, this has been my favorite mouse/trackball device. I work in video game audio development and spend long hours across multiple computers using software running on macOS and Windows. This mouse has not let me down in any way. Over the past year after many hours per day, this mouse does not negatively affect my wrist as so many others have. I find it very comfortable. The battery life is great. I can get about 4-6 weeks out of it before needing a charge and when I do need to plug it in, I can continue to use it since the port is on the front. I wish that the port on the mouse was micro USB but it's not a deal-breaker.I didn't have high expectations for the multi-computer features but in my experience it actually works and is very useful when I need it. I did have one small issue where the mouse would pass from my Mac's secondary monitor to my Windows laptop but it would not return from Windows to macOS. After that issue disappeared (a few reboots of every device involved seemed to fix it), I was able to successfully copy files across and then control three different computers, two running Windows and one Mac.",30-Aug-21

Had it since July 29th and it's been on it's first charge, which is quite good since it's used nearly constantly 7 hours a day 5 days a week.  The software works better on this one as well.

941,foxfaction,5,"I just bought this to get a nice reliable wireless mouse. And I have been pleasantly surprised time and time again. The scroll wheel is incredible. The wheel will freespin for literally 25 seconds, which is very useful for scrolling through long pages of code or long comment sections. The battery seems to last at least 2-3 weeks per charge, I haven't actually fully drained it yet. The button on the bottom lets you switch between devices, which is very handy. However, I did find that doing this on linux mint 20 would sometimes mess up the scrolling speed, making it extremely sensitive, requiring a disconnect and reconnect of the bluetooth device to repair, which kind of negates the usefulness of device switching feature a bit. But this is not a huge deal.The shape was a bit weird at first, but after a week I've come to really like it. I wish the forward/back thumb buttons on the mouse were a bit bigger. Also sometimes it takes 2-3 seconds to wake from sleep mode, which can be a little bit annoying sometimes, but it's not too bad.All in all, pretty good mouse. It is expensive but the super long battery life and the mousewheel that's basically a built in fidget-spinner makes this a fun way to use the computer. 9/10",25-Aug-21

As a bigger guy with big hands, it was also just the left button and scroll wheel I would use for Photoshop tools and the rest were clicking on the tools or using the keyboard to change things. Now with this I have a more comfortable hold on the mouse with a slight cant to the right making it less cumbersome on holding it, and all the extra buttons and extra wheel make it a pleasure to use! While there are set items for the buttons, you can also customize them along with gestures to customize your time in Photoshop, as well as other programs. I can't answer on the battery life or whether it's good for gaming, but so far, so good.",23-Aug-21

951,Graham C.,4,"So far I like the mouse.I really like the gestures function, and plan on testing to see if it works in games.The mouse is pretty big, so if your hands are small it's the wrong mouse for you.I wear medium latex gloves at work, and I found the mouse to almost be too large. It'd be more comfortable if it was 10% smaller. Not sure how logitech screws up the little thingsHere's my big gripes:THE SOFTWARE- I cant make macros when my other logitech mice can using their gaming software- At work I can't use their flow function because my work laptop is on different network than personal laptop, when I press the button on my logitech MX keys keyboard to switch input the mouse should follow, but instead I gotta flip the mouse over to press the button.- I'd like gestures to include more options, you can only do gesture button + up,down,left,right. I'd like to make more complex gestures to assign to less often used functions. Logitech's problem has always been the software, the tech can do these things if they'd get the software right.",20-Aug-21

It truly works on all surfaces, has solid button click, great features, and feels great in the hand.I love the scroll wheel that magnetically allows you to scroll line by line, or flick and zoom through a document or web page.I also love the multi computer functionality.  It allows selecting one of 3 different computers via a button on the bottom.  Where this is useful is when using it through bluetooth.  My wife and I have several laptops and this allows it to be paired with multiple laptops and it remembers each and connects to only the one with the associated setting which is changed by a button on the bottom.The rechargeable lithium battery lasts for weeks and the mouse can be used while charging via the USB-C cord.It's expensive but I'm so glad I spent a little extra to get such a solid mouse.",17-Aug-21

962,Ryan,1,"BEWARE: If you work for a large company that has software download restrictions, this mouse is not worth buying. For any of the additional features to work (anything more than a normal mouse, including the horizontal scroll wheel) you need to have the Logitech Options app installed on the computer. Since most large firms do not allow downloading 3rd party software, this mouse is not worth more than the $10-20 you would spend buying a cheap bluetooth mouse.I confirmed with Logitech Customer Support that there is no work around for this. You can not use another computer to set up the mouse settings and then use the mouse on the work laptop, the Logitech Options App MUST be installed for the extra mouse buttons and scroll wheel to work.

Wow, everything I had in the MX, PLUS the little button on the bottom that switches between three devices! OH YEA, I bought half a dozen of these, five still in the box. Because the MX Master is king for the next decade.If you want to do the same, keep your mouse batteries in the fridge and they will be fresh years from now when you want to use your new old mouse.",2-Aug-21

974,David T,4,"Pro's- More features than any other mouse (forward/back buttons, gesture button, 2 scroll wheels)- Smooth scrolling is good but it doesn't feel nearly as good as magic mouse or magic trackpad scrolling- ErgonomicCon's- Customization requires the logitech software which is generally reliable but buggy enough to cause aggravation (it crashes too often which breaks the mouse until software is restarted)- The level of customization in the logitech software is not sufficient. I want the ability to add modifier keys (eg forward/back button behavior would be modified by pressing command key).- Gesture button cannot be customized with external software like BetterTouchTool- Customization is local to the computer. You can tweak the mouse to get the sensitivity exactly right, but when you switch to another computer, you need to reinstall logitech options and redo your settings for each machine. It'd be great if the mouse could store your preferences on the device itself just like high-end keyboards.- It's very expensive. I haven't found it especially better than the $20 mouse I was using before. The only major difference is smooth scrolling and I don't think that's worth the $80 premium when I could buy a magic trackpad for that price.",31-Jul-21
975,James Mullinax,5,"I've never been one to splurge on a mouse but after my last one died I decided I wanted something with better quality.  This mouse has a great feel with both the grip and the scroll wheel.  At first I didn't know what to expect with the magnetic scroll wheel but I am very impressed.  It is indexed during normal operation but then when you scroll faster it switches to a totally smooth roll.  However, if you prefer a smooth scroll all the time there is a button to switch over.  I was also skeptical about a rechargeable mouse but this one lasts weeks (use of 1-2 hours per day).I haven't found the additional scroll wheel on the side to be very useful.  In MS Word the zoom is very glitchy and in Chrome it moves through the tabs way too fast.  I personally don't miss much from not using this extra wheel which is why I leave it at 5 stars.  Highly recommend, especially to business professionals.",25-Jul-21

The mouse allows you to rest your head naturally on it end it feels much different than many other mice out on the market right now. Yes it’s a spendy ordeal but worth itit’s a speedy little devil and it has many special buttons if you want to customize it. Battery life is good and it is a must if you do a great deal of computer work where you’re using a mouse frequently.oh just a little insight here… The light gray mouse looks great on the Amazon page but in real life it just is pretty ugly. I actually returned it and got the dark graphic one which is much more sleek and good looking.,25-Jul-21

979,Kim Bailey,3,"I just purchased this mouse because I have three Macintosh machines running different macOS and I need one mouse to move between each. Also, I am on different surfaces for each macOS machine, so I require a pointer device that can travel and is tough enough to withstand the punishment of 3D modeling work and higher end graphics work.  The fit and feel is what I have come to expect from the Logitech MX series since I have bricked three MX performance mice for constant daily use.  Battery life is also something I have come to anticipate with Logitech and with this new MX Master 3, battery life seems to be wonderful but this is where the romance ends.  Seems Logitech is seriously slipping in quality check and control of their online web presence and most certainly in their technical support across the gambit of contact methods.So when I started the registration and installation process, the website of course asked for the serial number and dropped me into a webpage that knows my macOS (as shown in the photo ""Download Stub"").  Thinking that a tech company would know if a software product they wrote would operate on an OS is to be expected.  However, this is not the case and after downloading the driver three times to make sure it was not me that did something wrong, I finally accepted the macOS alert of ""this software requires macOS 10.14 to run"".So, the next step was to ask for help and start a chat with Logitech to find the right driver.  This was a terrible mistake for it seems the person typing on the other end of the screen could not understand that their software was the issue and not my browser.  Four separate times the person typing told me to use another browser and I kept saying it is an OS problem not a Browser problem.  Finally, they got the message only to inform me that someone would be emailing me back in 72 hours with a reply. I continued to ask for a legacy version of database of older drivers but they never answered me back after 20 minutes.Now comes the crazy part where I called... in short the person said I should ""upgrade to 10.14 or ""buy"" a new laptop so it will work with their product"" which was completely unacceptable.  At each suggestion I kept referring to the webpage that clearly instructs and states the driver is for 10.13.6 macOS and it does not work on that  OS.  Finally, the person tells me there is no solution for their software compatibility issue, there is no legacy or older version to download and ended the call.After an hour of searching Logitechs website I finally found the page (Logitech Drivers) that has a semi good solution for the mouse. It is far from perfect and my new mouse scroll feature does not perform in the same manner or ease as my old MX Revolution did before it started losing its place. However, it is working, this version of the software I found does allow to address each button and set actions for the mouse but it will not reside in the control panel as it once did for the earlier Logitech mice.  On a scale fro one to ten, I give Logitech live customer support a ONE, their quality assurance for web information a THREE and the text chat support a TWO.  If you're 10.14 and beyond, this is the mouse for you.  However if you are 10.13.6, then the solution for the driver is in the photo attached. If you're a windows user, then check it out and drive it first.",24-Jul-21

981,Brian,3,"I've used an original MX Master 1 for four years. It's a great mouse. The new MX Master 3 mouse has a few deal breakers: the scroll wheel magnet vibrates so much it hurts my index finger, the buttons (particularly the thumb gesture button) are harder to press, the shape feels slightly worse in the hand, the polling rate is actually lower than previous models, and it feels even sweatier than my original MX Master.However, if the MX Master 3 were my FIRST MX Master mouse I might have been ok with it, but for now I will resort only to the 1/2s if I need a replacement.

Maybe they are to protect the mouse feet I thought...Apparently I was wrong. Those are the mouse feet. They are also stupid easy to remove. When they are off, the mouse has so much resistance that it's almost unusable.Considering that there is no warning, no documentation, no real manual or quick start guide, I'm taking a star off.

The fact that it does not work while plugged in with the USB-C cable is completely idiotic. Why in hell would you prevent the mouse from working while plugged in?  The reason this is a problem is because the bluetooth connection is extremely laggy. The mouse is constantly sticking when working in Maya and Houdini, it is really bothersome.

Its profile is significantly taller than previous versions, and you definitely feel it. While it is tolerable after a while, I really don't enjoy using it.Secondly, scrolling is now noticeably less responsive. Unlike previous versions, switching between smooth and tactile scrolling is now automatic and controlled by software instead of a mechanical button.

I'm so impressed with this mouse -- it works amazing with my late-2019 MBP 16"" via Bluetooth and also via the unifying receiver. I really thought it was going to be too big and uncomfortable for my hands before purchasing compared to the MX Anywhere 2S I still have, but it took me literally about 5-minutes to get accustomed to it.

1006,B. Hill,2,"This could be a great mouse but it has a fundamental flaw, the scroll wheel. How is the average review above 4 stars is mind boggling. The scroll wheel either does not scroll a page enough or in the case of zooming in/out zooms too much with a single ""click"". In the end I found this scroll wheel just not working. It is a finicky thing and I don't know why it is so hard to use but it just doesn't work right compared to the $25 mouse it replaced. My scroll finger is getting tired working so hard. Bad scroll ergonomics.Other more minor complaints but ones that should not be in a $100 mouse: - The ergonomics of the forward/back buttons could be improved. With some practice I mostly get used to them. But they could be more pronounced and they feel a little high. - Software: why do you keep creating new software, Logitech? My Logitech Keyboard uses different software than my old Logitech wired mouse which uses different software than the new Logitech mouse. For the love of humanity, your products should have a consistent experience. I used to think buying Logitech would mean I get a more integrated solution but no it is more fractured buying products from the same company. - Software settings: the Logitech Options doesn't even allow changing basic settings of the mouse. If you want to change the number of lines the scroll wheel moves then you need to go to the Windows settings. Why? - The ""SmartShift"" feature takes a bit of tweaking to get working right and I still don't find it works great. - For a ""professional"" series mouse there are no advance customization of the buttons. Yes, you can customize a single function for a button which provides many options on what it will do. And yes, you can customize behavior for different applications (which I haven't found that useful). But you can't create macros and you can't create ""key combinations"". For example, it would be great to hold shift and use the horizontal wheel to adjust volume. But no, it is either configured to do horizontal scrolling or volume control ... not both with a hotkey. Seems limited for a top of the line mouse.It's a shame, the other features make it a great mouse: USB-C rechargeable, otherwise good ergonomics, and high precision tracking. But the vertical scrolling issues and the poor software are inexcusable on any mouse that costs more than $25 much less $100.",5-Jul-21

1013,E.K.E.,1,"I wanted to like this mouse, but I just can't.  Sure, it's comfortable and has all the features I was looking for, but it just doesn't work properly in a Linux environment.  I haven't used Windoze for over a decade so I used to having things not work the same.  Running Mint 20.1 this mouse will randomly stutter and freeze.  This is unacceptable while trying to edit video (or anytime really).  This product is advertised as being Linux compatible, yet there is no software from Logitech to do so.  This has been a problem with them for many years.  Check for yourself, do a search for Linux support on the Logitech website.  You will see generic canned responses and sidestepped issues among the many complaints.I also only get about a week before I need to recharge the battery, no where near the advertised life.I have a week left in my Amazon return window.  It's going back.  It's just too expensive to let it sit around unused.  I would have been fine with the price had it fully and properly worked like it was advertised to.  To charge $100 for a mouse that the company KNOWS doesn't do what they say it does is unacceptable.  This was my last ever Logitech product.  Now I have to find something else that works.  More downtime from work due to their misrepresentation of their product.",1-Jul-21

1019,Ron Anderson,3,"This mouse was a replacement of my all time favorite mouse--the Logitech Performance MX.The MX Master 3 felt good and it fit very well in my large hands.  It was very comfortable.  The mouse was too light in that it would frequently slide off the mouse pad and even spin in place when I removed my hand from it.  I eventually became annoyed with having to constantly reorient the mouse.  The mouse was responsive both using the USB and bluetooth connectivity.  My biggest concern with this mouse was that the left button does not have a distinct response (feel) when clicked.  There was motion but no ""click"".  In some cases, the left-click did not even register.  My previous mouse left button failed so this was a big issue for me.  It felt to me as though the left-mouse button was designed to fail.  I returned this mouse.",29-Jun-21

Not worth the money though, I cannot suggest this product. The whole reason I paid extra for the mouse was so that I could switch it between my tablet, laptop, and desktop seamlessly, however it does not offer that at all. It is a pain in the ass. I could get it to work, but by the time I download all these special drivers, install special software so their overpriced mouse can work, it is easier to grab a 5 dollar wireless mouse and plug it in.",21-Jun-21

1034,King Kong,1,This Mouse is built well and ergonomic were needed. If you are planning to buy this for your M1 Macbook however I would not recommend this and advise you to look elsewhere. The mouse is very laggy and and the scroll wheel is a chore to use. Even after fully charging and putting on the given dongle it did not solve the issue. I tried the mouse with my PC which works great however that wasn't what I needed this for. Also this mouse is NOT for gaming.,18-Jun-21

1040,Cavicchi,5,"It is both ergonomic and functional. You can program buttons with a wide choice of options. Another nice feature is the mouse is extremely quiet. Installation and setup was very easy. What I find quite amazing is with all the buttons, I never accidentally hit one of those programmable buttons. A mouse is a mouse and then there is this mouse,  a mouse that looks great and combines function with smooth operation.I have it connected via the USB dongle connected to a USB 3.0 hub that connects to my computer. Using the unifying software makes it easier to install mouse and MX Keys keyboard. Of course, that is when connecting via USB as opposed to bluetooth. Overall I think this mouse pairs excellently with the MX Keys Keyboard.",15-Jun-21

I have been using the magic mouse 2 for three years and half and I never ever had similar pain until I got this ""ergonomic"".Secondly **most importantly** the scrolling on this mouse is an utter disaster.

I took away a star, however, because the setup instructions are completely useless.  Typical of Logitech.  There is software called Logitech Options that you must use to configure this and the MX keyboard.  In addition, when you try to set this device up with another computer, there is exactly ZERO information on how to do that.  I finally got it done by trial and error, but Logitech needs to hire someone who can write complete documentation and then include it in the package!  However, once set up, this is a great mouse!",11-Jun-21
1048,mj,2,"I've 2-3 versions of every MX since the MX2 including the portables. I upgraded to this from an MX2 that I loved but wanted to upgrade to usbc.

I hardly remember ever charging it.I must charge this mouse once every 6-9 days. It's so bad I keep a use brick in front of it to charge it.I really can't think of any positives over the MX2.Also, do NOT get the grey. It is the most difficult mouse I've ever had to keep clean, it gets disgusting looking in a week and I'm not eating cheetos and mountain dew at my desk.

It feels very nice in the hand, scroll wheel is very quiet, if not completely silent. It's not too heavy and not too light, feels like a solid build. The stainless steel used on the scroll wheel feels nice, and helps with using the free scroll. The thumb wheel on the side might be stainless steel as well because it feels very high quality as well. Being able to customize the functions of the gesture button and thumb wheel is super nice to have, didn't know what I was missing out on.",4-Jun-21

It doesn't seem to like ANY surface I put it on.  Also, I use a standing desk that has a separate platform for the keyboard and mouse which I like to have inclined very slightly for ergonomic purposes and the mouse SLIDES all over the place.  Can wait for the OG mouse I ordered to arrive.  What a piece of junk, and overprices at that.  And the batter life; it's fine but having to plug it in is a pain in the rear.  I'd rather just replace the batteries.",1-Jun-21

1068,Carlos E. Ruiz,2,"Software is great, cool design, durability is solid, button placement is good. However, the ""ergonomic"" structure hurt my hand for a week after just a day of use. The issue is that the ""hump"" (the peak height of the mouse) is so far to the rear and at such a steep incline. Your wrist MUST be an inch or more above the mouse surface, otherwise your wrist will feel very uncomfortable and quickly painful. That's a fail, which is a shame because it's otherwise perfect. So if you are one who likes to rest your wrist, look elsewhere.",1-Jun-21

1070,destryer,5,"I work full time on both Mac/Windows laptops now and really started despising the ergonomics of Magic Mouse (MM2) . The shape and size of the Apple MM I think Apple must use children's hands to design mice. This Logitech mouse fits my hand well in a more natural position for my hand and thumb and stopped all the hand cramping and arm pain from using the required crab-pincer grip with the MM. While I miss the built in functionality of the MM that Apple won't share, the Logitech has a side scroll and a hefty scroll wheel for verticle scroll with a free scroll too. The side scroll is nice on the Apple MM and the It works with The triple multi device swap is nice though I wish they could move the device swap button to the top somewhere. The USB-C charge port is in the front not underneath like Apple's ""innovative"" underneath port which renders the mouse useless until you can get enough charge to get by. Overall I'm glad to have switched and relagated the MM to selling to someone else.",31-May-21

1073,ENGME,5,"I do quite a bit of CAD work as an engineer and am constantly on multiple computers.  Mouse feels comfortable and works well.  I have the keyboard as well.  This is a pretty slick way of controlling 3 machines with just a single mouse and keyboard.  I definitely recommend using the setting to hold control to switch between computers.  I originally had it where if I touched the edge of the screen it would jump over to the other computer.  This started causing issues since it takes a second for the mouse to jump over to the other machine.  With the Control button, it won't go over unless I want it to.  The only down side is that if you have a VPN on one of the machines, it sometimes stops working.  You then have to use the keyboard ""1, 2 or 3"" buttons to switch which is not a big deal for being able to switch seamlessly between 3 machines.",28-May-21

Scroll slowly and you get tactile feedback for precision.  Give it a good spin and it'll spin freely,  taking you quickly to the top or bottom of the page.But the best feature by far is the secondary thumb scroll wheel.  I don't think I can use a mouse without this feature from here on out.  Being able to navigate left and right in excel, Vision, CAD, etc... such a simple idea but a huge quality of life enhancement.Honestly best mouse for productivity I've ever used.  Very highly recommended.  The only thing I wish it had was a docking station for recharging.  But it can easily go over a month on a single charge,  so not a show stopper.",25-May-21

Wood,1,"I thought the first unit I got was faulty, but after discovering the inconsistently-working scroll wheel I noticed other people having the same issue with this mouse, in the reviews.  I got a replacement, and it's exactly the same.  It's a design flaw, not a malfunction.Both scroll-wheels are affected.  Equal flicks and movements of the wheels produces different results.  Sometimes wheel spins do almost nothing.  I've also noticed right-click button not responding occasionally.  I'm pretty turned-off by Logitech after this waste of time.For $100 bucks this mouse should be perfect, but it can't even get the basics right.",25-May-21
1079,Jan-Felix Abellera,1,"The “magnetic technology” for the scroll wheel is literally so bad. We get it, magnets are cool, but removing the existing working and amazing scroll wheel from the original MX master and 2S and replacing it with magnets was a terrible design choice. “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it”. The magnets provide absolutely 0 resistance when in ratcheting mode. You can barely even tell the difference between ratcheting mode and free spin mode. And as a result, the sensitivity of the smart shift feature feels set at one point regardless of how you set it. Everything else is good, but the mouse has been ruined.

1105,Pat L,1,"This is a mouse that is getting awesome reviews on various sites, so maybe my expectations were too high. My main application is office use. I was looking for a mouse that would fit my hands better than a previous generation Logitech Anywhere that died on me recently.Ergonomics: there is a thumb rest integrated to the mouse. It didn't work for me as the friction where the thumb rest is noticeable after a couple of hours of regular use. Also, the horizontal scrolling wheel is not naturally easy to reach, sames things for the thumb buttons, when the hand is resting on the mouse and the thumb on the thumb rest.Feel: the mouse feels too heavy.,The worst thing is the main scrolling wheel. When the ratchet is on, you can feel the (loose?) magnets rattling and bouncing off. This completely disappears when the ratchet is off, but it was a deal killer for me. I even suspected there was actually a defect with the mouse I got. Apparently, unlike the new Anywhere 3 mouse, you cannot adjust how hard the ratchet notches feel. Also, the new Anywhere 3 doesn't exhibit the rattling/bouncing behavior, although it has the same automatic freewheeling SmartShift feature as the Master 3.Noise: the rattling &amp; bouncing sound of the wheel in ratchet mode was really annoying to me. Maybe there was a defect with the unit I had.I returned the mouse suspecting a defect and ordered the Anywhere 3 model that is perfect.",13-May-21
1106,Jeff,3,"Picked up this mouse after wanting an upgrade from my MX Anywhere 2S. I liked most everything about this mouse except for the scroll wheel. I was skeptical about all of the reviews pointing out issues with the scroll wheel; however, it really is that bad (for me at least). I tried configuring the scroll wheel to try and get it feeling good to no avail. The input is very inconsistent, especially when trying to make fine movements.It's a shame, I love the mouse otherwise but the scroll wheel makes this mouse unusable for me.  I had to return it and stick with my MX Anywhere 2S.",12-May-21
1107,Steve E. Markow,2,"I loved this mouse for the first year or so... but there were always minor issues, like the functions not working, like side scroll, or the additional buttons. I have Logi Options software, the most recent version, everything the newest, upgraded, and my goodness I finally had to accept reality today and shout out loud, ""THIS MOUSE SUCKS!!!!"" -- I don't care how awesome it is and how much I love it when it actually works.The problem is more than 50% of the time it only functions as a normal 2 button mouse! And when that happens, I spend so much time trying to fix it, or getting annoyed and having to use my trackpad in addition to this ""2 button mouse"" in order to do things like scrolling down or side scroll.Seriously, Logitech... get your GD act together. Charge more for a mouse if you have to, but make sure it effing works! I must have spent several hours just trying to troubleshoot this mouth in 2021 alone.",12-May-21

1109,Shauna,1,DO NOT PURCHASE!Yes it’s amazing! All it’s features are amazing! I agree but a couple month after I’m not sure if it’s the sensor but it’s lagging to a very great extent! It’s completely unusable. Again I’m not sure if it’s the Bluetooth or sensor here but the device just stops working altogether. The computer recognizes it but it just ceases to work!!! Which is fine for a $5 mouse but not for such an expensive essential piece of hardware. So now I have to get a new mouse and I’m paranoid as **** because I have clients waiting for their jobs and what if it happens again. So thanks Logitech for the mental health issues caused by your product! And I’m outside the 30 day warranty so thanks for the terrible investment too.,11-May-21

1122,Matt N.,5,"After much research I bought the MX Master 3 and after a few months of use I have the following takeaways:PROS:- Wireless and holds charge for at least a week after using 5hr per day AND USB-C!- Sleek and very comfortable/ergonomic. I really appreciate the heavier weight.- Bluetooth connectivity is reliable and switches fast and reliably between Windows, iOS, and Android.- Free spin scrolling feature is addictingly useful. I miss it when using other mice.- The side scroll and forward/back buttons are well placed and usefulCONS:- The mouse keep charge by shutting off when not in use (that's good), but the mouse takes about a second to turn back on when I start to use it again after a pause. The pause is noticeable, but not enough to make me use any other mouse.OF NOTE: I use Bluetooth on my Windows machine and when I accidentally turn off Bluetooth - which I do fairly often - I'm left with no connection to turn it back on (my keyboard is BT too) funny, but noteworthy.",6-May-21

1127,Amazon Customer,1,"So, the wheel does have two modes - ""free"" and ""fixed"". Fixed feels like a standard scroll wheel, and free allows it to spin easily.The problem is that even when in the ""fixed"" mode, when you scroll at a moderate speed, it loosens and ""switches"" to free mode. As in, you suddenly stop feeling any feedback, and your wheel is just spinning without your knowledge.Absolutely unusable for games.

I decided to give it a second shot since I like the shape/feel of it, but guess what, this one's response is even worse, the sensor went off after one week and I keep having trouble on the lagging/ responding of the mouse.

It seems there are not a lot of mice out there that have a decent horizontal scroll option, something necessary for any video or music production software. The Magic Mouse does it very smoothly, you just scroll left and right with your finger and it is precise. The MX master 3 has a thumbwheel that doesn't even register half the time and when it does it is anything but precise, it skips around and by the time I've found my place on the timeline again I may as well have not bothered using the thumbwheel. It is very disappointing considering the price of this mouse, especially since the rest of the functions are really great.

Anyone that has davinci resolve know that it tends to crash if you haven't saved in awhile. So having the button configured to save I made it a habit to just click it after every change I make.

1143,Avid Reader,3,"This mouse has some nice bells and whistles. It fits nicely into my hand. It has additional buttons for convenience. Logitech has even created profiles for different applications where different buttons map to different applications with a per-application configuration. It's nice that it can use either Bluetooth or USB. It has a rechargeable battery built-in, so no more buying batteries. And, it can be turned off to preserve the battery charge. The left mouse button can be too sensitive. What's really missing is the ability to create my own per application profile or settings that Logitech didn't provide (or at least I haven't found a way of doing it yet). What I really find irksome is the scroll amount associated with the scroll wheel. It scrolls too much for a small amount of wheel movement. Especially in small windows and dialogs boxes. I have to actually move the mouse and use the scroll bar which defeats the purpose of having a scroll wheel in the first place. The poor scroll behavior really makes me miss my MSFT Arc Touch mouse. Quite surprisingly, Logitech hasn't provided a setting for configuring how many lines to scroll for each scroll-wheel ratchet notch. This setting is available on the Arc Touch mouse. Neither does the scroll amount adjust with the speed of the scroll wheel. It should scroll less when spinning the scroll wheel slowly and scroll more when the wheel is spun faster. It has a fixed scroll amount regardless of how fast/slow you spin the wheel which is also annoying when I want to scroll large amounts and am trying to spin the wheel fast. Hopefully, Logitech would fix that.",23-Apr-21

1158,Chad,3,"After reading a multitude of reviews and a dozen or so YouTube videos, I decided to pull the plug on the new MX 3.  The MX Keyboard is a staple in my Mac based studio where my private world revolves around graphic art, writing, and music composition, and my professional world around software engineering.  I spend 90% of my day with my hands on some form of controller.  I have enjoyed many Logitech devices over the years but this is my first foray into their higher end devices preferring Apple's magic trackpads in the past.<br>To begin with, all the reviews are spot on concerning the MX 3, it is an amazing device.. however, the ergonomics did not fit my Medium hands.  As a pianist and guitarist my hands have an abnormal amount of reach compared to many but my index finger just could not fully reach, cover, or comfortably operate the MX3's main scrolling wheel.  In short, the height of the palming area of the mouse is too high for me.Yes, the MX3's all steel wheel and magnetic feedback are better than the 2S, but aside from the heftier weight, I preferred the position of the main scrolling wheel as well as all the buttons on the 2S including the placement and composition of the thumb scroll.  I chose to disengage the ratcheting feedback on the 2S and personally love it.Ergonomically the 2S is far better for my particular hands.  The 2S is slightly shorter in height and slightly wider in width.  My farthest right 2 fingers have more to rest and hold onto compared to the MX3, and strangely I also found the bottom left button and left buttons alongside the horizontal thumb scroll wheel were better placed for my needs.  The MX3's approach of the left ""fwd""/""bwd"" buttons are a better concept but their placement was just not correct for me.Although this review is as much about the MX2S as for the MX3, I had a hard time finding many reviews covering both.  Hope this helps someone.I also purchased the new Anywhere 3 and also love it.. in fact I may find that I actually prefer it, time will tell :D.</br>",18-Apr-21

The scroll wheel stopped working. It would start to scroll down on a page, stop, and then page back up where I was originally at. I thought it was an OS issue but it was the mouse because this Logitech Mouse has no issues scrolling. Also, the VicTsing mouse started to have issues with the left click button. It used to have a nice crisp ""click"" sound but started to have a dull and hollow ""click"" sound. The VicTsing mouse was inexpensive but a complete waste of money.I read very good reviews about the Logitech MX Master Mouse and I'm very glad I got it. The things I love about this mouse are:• Functions like a corded mouse! There is no lag at all.• The ergonomics feels great with my hand. I work 8 hours a day using this mouse and it feels very comfortable. I  have big hands and it fits really well.• The scroll wheel works great and it feels very sturdy.• The battery life seems like it will be very good and I really like how it charges with a USB-C cable.• There is no need to turn this mouse off.  It will go in sleep mode after it has not been in use for a while and  when you move it for the first time, the battery LED indicator will light up for a few seconds.

When you download the software you can customize everything button, rollers and the software interface is easy to program and esthetically pleasing.  There's literally hundreds of ways to customize all the functions fir any type of user.I'm not a gamer but I presume this has to be one of if not the most customizable pieces of hardware on the market with the exception of a joy stick.  For an office user who uses multiple spread sheets, word documents and publishing software and needs to multi task between all of your work this mouse will do everything you could possibly need and more.As for me, I don't use very much of this mouses potential at all. The reason I purchased it was because it looked really cool and seemed to be well built so coming from a consumer who doesn't mind spending a little more and making a big splash, I am extremely impressed.  It is extremely well built and feels very solid when in use. It's ergonomically perfect and extremely comfortable to continuous hourly use. It can be used with the USB dongle or with blue tooth if you need to free up a USB port. The battery life seems to last forever. I've been using it for over a month and I'm at 99% of battery life.  In the unlikely event your battery goes dead you can plug the charge cord into a USB port. Bottom line, if you don't mind spending a little more on of the most programmable mouse on the market weather you're a full out gamer, a 10K office working or code writer or just someone who wants a totally cool, bullet proof, comfortable cool looking mouse, this is for you.

There is no way to turn off the mouse acceleration which leads me to a lot of miss clicks. The scroll wheel would sometimes ignore scrolling if you scroll too slow, but if you set the scroll faster, it scrolls too fast. The thumb buttons are harder to reach, feels sharp, and too small. The palm button is far out of reach. The size of the mouse is somewhat smaller and much heavier than my MX518. It does not cover my whole palm if I use a wrist pad and partially covers my palm if I don't use a wrist pad. Mac installation is not straight forward.

It feels nice, has nice features, but the one thing that dropped my stars is that I spent the entire time putting up with laggy, skippy, jumpy cursor.I've changed software and updated many times since I purchased. Tried removing software. Moved my dongle to half a dozen locations around my desk, different ports, the list goes on. Advanced tweaks in the Device Manager (Windows 10).Nothing seems to fix this mouse, the cursor jumping around sporadically sometimes. Obviously it will do it during higher CPU operations like first opening a large web page, or opening an app, etc. But these jitters usually only last a couple seconds for the thing to open. However, other times I'm not doing much, just typing, writing code, reading a page. It will get jittery and just keep doing it, skipping across the screen, making me click the wrong things, making it hard to center on a link, etc.I'm done fighting with it. I connected my older M705 Marathon Mouse until I can find a solution. At least to my memory, I didn't have this kind of issue with my Marathon, I've used it like 5 years straight.I'm not trying to bag on Logitech, since the Marathon is also theirs, and my G915 wireless keyboard.A bunch of YouTubers seems like the G915 and MX Master 3 combo but it certainly didn't work for me, I'm out of options.If Logitech has an answer to this, I'm all ears, or if they can patch drivers or whatever it takes to make the wireless more solid, I'll wait.

1180,A. Heisey,5,"Background - I purchased this mouse early in my freshman year of college. Prior to that, I was using an older Logitech M310 mouse. However, it started to become unreliable, so I started to search for a replacement. In searching for a mouse, I desired an ergonomic, bluetooth mouse with a horizontal scrollwheel. This happened to be the only option on the market that fit those requirements. I was not disappointed with the purchase.Wheel - The primary wheel has been even more useful than I anticipated. I did not realize how much time I spent scrolling until I started using this mouse. The horizontal wheel has also been a revelation in my computer usage. In using Microsoft OneNote, I can use that wheel in tandem with the regular wheel for 2 axis scrolling. Meanwhile, if I have Spotify or Chrome open, I can use the horizontal wheel to control audio volume. Having this extra utility has been very convenient.Sensor - Additionally, its sensor is fantastic. It is very accurate, and with adjustable DPI settings, can be adjusted to your preferences. I have not used it on glass, but have successfully used it on some surfaces other mice would not track on (such as fabric or carpet).Software - My only complaint is that the software Logitech provides can be occasionally finnicky, althought it is generally reliable. The primary issues occur if you have the mouse on for a long time (say, 8 hours), as it seems to forget the customized actions I have set for certain buttons in certain applications. That said, a simple turning off and back on of the mouse rectifies any issues. I have not tried its multidevice capabilities, so I canot speak to that.Battery - The battery has been wonderful. This is my first rechargeable mouse, and it has proven to be remarkable. I have charged it probably 3 or 4 times total after using it for hours per day for 7 months straight, and has provided me with warnings each time it needed charging.Ergonomics - This mouse's ergonomics are fantastic. Prior to purchasing this, my wrist hurt after using my computer for more than 2or 3 hours. Now, I hae used my laptop for periods of 10 or more hours with no wrist fatigue. Conincidentally, the ergonomics also make the mouse visually unique. I have gotten numerous compliments on this mouse by my peers.Summary - Overall, this mouse is easily one of my favorite pieces of technology. If you are looking for a gaming mouse, you may want to look elsewhere. If you are an engineer using CAD all the time, you may want to look at the 3dConnexion CadMouse. However, if you are looking for a very high quality mouse for general computer work and productivity, this is a fantastic option, if not the best.",10-Apr-21
1181,Kyle,1,"In order to switch over to another computer using this mouse you must turn the mouse over and press the corresponding number associated with the computer. The problem - I move between computers quickly. Because of this,  I am constantly turning the mouse over and it requires 2 hands. This creates a lot of wasted time. I cannot imagine why Logitech would not place the change button on top. I no longer use the mouse. Expensive lesson for me. Frustrating.",10-Apr-21
1182,Kirk Henry,5,"I'm not a computer expert, nor a gamer, but I use one quite a bit. I wasn't looking for a new mouse, I was totally satisfied with my basic wireless Logitech. I watch a lot of online technology videos and just about all of them kept raving about the new MX3 wireless mouse. I decided to give it a try and I'm really  liking it so far. Since I was already familiar with Logitech products, setup was a breeze (just download the Logitech options software). This mouse is already configured by default to run just about any app that's designed for it. You can also change the defaults to personalize the mouse, which I've already done, to your liking. Ergonomically, it fits my hands to a tee and the scroll wheels are AWESOME ! It's not cheap ($99) but it has almost limitless potential and I feel like I'm only beginning to scratch the surface.Very satisfied !",10-Apr-21
1183,Keith Gumbs,5,Good mouse for productivity.,10-Apr-21
1184,Brandon Turner,5,"I have had this mouse for about a year now.The brilliant: horizontal scroll and the regular scroll. I work with many large documents and medical ""images"" that I have to scroll through. Being able to basically scroll through without having to make that same repetitive motion helps save my fingers from becoming fatigued (it's also quite and quite satisfyingly smooth). The ""flow"" feature to switch between multiple monitors/computers with a single mouse is really brilliant. If you have a use case for it, you'll enjoy it and it's easier to set up than the software/network version I was using before.The good: it is sensitive and precise. It allows for subtle movements well and does not jump around. The battery life is perfectly adequate for my needs, I charge it every now and then when the light indicates. The size seems fine for me, not too large, not too small. I have slightly above average hand size for a man. Bluetooth set up is a breeze.The OK: the back and forward buttons are positioned a tad too high to be comfortably used. I have to tilt my whole hand up in order to reach. For someone using a mouse 10-12+ hours a day, those kind of movements are not comfortable.The not great: the button for the thumb rest platform is too small of a target and positioned too far back to easily click. It requires a kind of ""rolling"" maneuver to hit it with my thumb ""knuckle"". I essentially do not use any of the buttons on this mouse for these reasons. I also wish it had better mapping options.The unknown: I do not game so can't speak to its value for that. Its durability seems fine for the past year, but no idea if it holds up well going forward.Overall: 5/5 for me. It's too good at the things I really care about to knock it down to 4 stars. I enjoy using this and even if it lacked the buttons entirely, I'd still be very happy with this mouse, so I just pretend they aren't there. They don't get in the way and I never accidentally click them.",9-Apr-21
1185,Hannah R. Novotny,5,"Feels like the lexus of computer mice. It feels incredible in my hand, very comfortable and nice. Buttons are reprogrammable and the wheel is very cool, love the option to switch modes.One flaw, and this is a big one for me: I work in Autodesk Maya and I frequently use the middle mouse button to drag things around in the viewport/graph editor. Using the middle mouse feels a bit stiff and takes a lot more effort, as compared to my cheap old walmart mouse. However I reprogrammed one of the thumb buttons to be the middle mouse button and it's a lot more manageable. I wont dock a star for this because I know most people wont have to deal with this and it is an excellent mouse.",9-Apr-21

I use an HDMI switch between the computers and monitor since I usually don't use my laptop until after work. I was using a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse, but I had to remove the IR receiver and place it into whichever laptop I was using. This lead me to search for a bluetooth solution and I came across the MX Keys and MX Master 3. The setup was simple. One can link up to 3 computers. My MacBook Pro is linked as #1, Boot Camp running Windows 10 on the MacBook is #2, and my work laptop is #3. Now, when I want to transition from my work laptop to my personal one, I select the number on the keyboard and mouse and tap the HDMI switch and I'm done. My workspace is simple and efficient. it was well worth the investment for me since it simplifies my productivity.",8-Apr-21

I'm pleased with the side buttons, but the scroll wheel will, annoyingly, switch to free rolling if you scroll fast enough, even in ratcheted mode.Purchased this mouse primarily because of its advertised ability to switch seamlessly between multiple connected devices. This is an absolute lie. The button to switch between devices is on the bottom of the mouse, meaning in order to switch between connected devices, you have to stop what you're doing and flip the thing over to access the button. I'm baffled that this design made it past the earliest stages of product development.",6-Apr-21

1195,Mark,3,"While this mouse is very nice and great for ergonomics with a lot of features, Logitech still has not been able to overcome the bluetooth connectivity issues they have had for most all their mice. I had the same issue with the MX2. Hence the 3 star rating.First day out of the package it paired and worked great. The next morning, the mouse sporadically connected and disconnected from bluetooth. My PC showed as paired but flickered back-and-forth to connected. Turned the mouse off and back on, unpaired and repaired and still no joy. Software is updated but no cure there either. For a $100 mouse you would think they would have things worked out. I can only use it with the included dongle. If you don't mind not being able to rely on the bluetooth feature then this is a great mouse.",6-Apr-21

Only good thing about it is the battery life, it lasts weeks without charge.",4-Apr-21

1200,K. K.,5,"Product description says full charge lasts up-to 70 days, but in my experience it was more like 25-30 days. It's not a big deal for me personally (as it charges to full in like an hour or two and is still fully usable while wired) and is pretty much the only ""complain"" I have (and even then, only b/c it doesn't match the product description). It's very ergonomic / comfortable to use.

1201,UWSUP,4,"This mouse is fantastic, but I had to dock a star.  The issue is the right mouse button.  It is way too easy to accidentally click the right button while using this mouse.  I use a fingertip-style grip, sometimes switching to a claw grip.  I have fewer issues with a claw grip, but fingertip and palm grippers beware.  Style a fantastic mouse, but expect that you will accidentally hit the right mouse button.  The button travel is very low and the way the mouse is set up pushes your hand to lean on that side.",2-Apr-21

I have and am experiencing some lag issues, skipping etc but I don't think it's the mouse's fault, believe it's an issue with an 8 year old Dell desktop. I'm working through it, messing with programs that may interfere and it DOES seem to be helping...but it's an awesome mouse. Pairing with Photoshop, Audacity etc is a breeze. I haven't used this to game on though, can't say how that'll work out. I've always had great luck with Logitech and Logitech G products. I know some haven't but...I've never had an issue.

I've installed all of Logitech's software, the latest versions of drivers software, etc. etc., and if after a couple hours paired with one device, it's impossible to switch back. Logitech offers only two solutions (clear out and reset all your bluetooth settings—doesn't work); and use their supplied dongle, which frankly is ridiculous.

I often find myself switching back and forth with very little effort. This thing can even pair to my phone! (though I find that the MX Keys keyboard is far more relevant for phone use).I've bought 5+ Razer mice and roughly 3+ Logitech mice (mice designed for FPS, MMO, etc..), this by far and away has the best grip/feel to it. The additional buttons are well placed, easy to rebind, and are completely sufficient for all my gaming related key-mappings. For work (software engineer), I find the gesture pad highly useful for swapping screens on my MacBook + additional monitors. I actually get a lot of use out of the side scroll wheel as well.Stop thinking about it, just buy it. You won't regret it.",27-Mar-21
1217,Russell Georgen,1,"The sole purpose of spending many dollars on the MX keys and Mouse was for the easy-switch.  Even with Flow, it does not work well.  I expected better from Logitech!  First, my mouse is not following easy-switch, second, using flow going from y stream book to Mac the Keyboard does not follow. Next the design of putting the switch button on the bottom of the mouse is a horrible idea!  At least if you are going to use software for functions, give me the option to set Duo fn to switch!Now lets just talk about flow and options.  I have a work computer that I am not allowed to installed software on.  So even if flow worked as expected I can not use for my work notebook.  Going from work notebook to mac is 98% of the switching I do.  Logitech, it would have been so much easier to have the mouse pair with keyboard and keyboard and mouse pair with computer.  Even if you have to pair both with a computer, have the keyboard ""EASY-switch"" tell the mouse to follow.   I really thought I could at least get flow and easy switch to work from my steam book and mac, but that has been fruitless as well.   Now I have wasted so much time trying to get this all to work together, I am unable to return it all.  I will be posting this as a review on Amazon. ",26-Mar-21

1221,Waew,2,"I heard many good reviews about this mouse so I thought I should give it a try. I cannot comment on gaming or battery life because I don’t play game and I try it only a few minutes. This is my issues.<br>1) This is not ergonomic for me at all. I started hurt my arm and shoulder after I tried around 15 minutes. The arc is too high and the mouse is too big for my hand. If I place my hand to easily reach vertical scroll wheel, I cannot reach the thumb button easily because it’s too far.2) I am not a fan of the horizontal scroll wheel on the side. I wish to have horizontal scroll wheel at the same as vertical scroll wheel.3) Although you can set the button for each program you work, you cannot set “Paste Value only” for other programs rather than in Excel. You also cannot set a keystroke macro for this mouse to set “Paste Value”.4) Last but important is that the serial number on the bottom of the mouse and on the box is different. Also, it’s different than the serial number I saw on “My Order” page. So, I am concerned about the authenticity of the product.I want to like it so much but I think I need to return this mouse.

With that said, the MX3 is currently my go-to mouse for long days, for two reasons: it partners well with my MX Keys keyboard and the tiny USB-A Unify dongles allow this mouse (and the keyboard) to easily be shared across the computers on my desk with a button press on the bottom of the mouse and on the keyboard, eliminating the need for multiple keyboards.Unify also allows the mouse/keyboard to automatically ""flow"" from one screen to another, if the computers are on the same network (sorry, if one of the computers is running a VPN, this will probably NOT work).Overall, very happy with this mouse.",24-Mar-21

1233,Saul Rodriguez,3,"I really really wanted to love this mouse. I'd read so many positive reviews on it. It did have some negative reviews on the scroll wheel. It is a known issue, there a plenty of forums on it but, I wanted to give it a shot. Sadly as much as I loved all the convenient features on it like the software, the customization with the function buttons, and the ergonomics of it. In the end the scroll wheel was what did it for me. I used for two days and just couldn't stand it. Especially using it for work were I had to scroll though pages of information. I noticed a drastic difference on how the scroll wheel works for my Dell work computer VS my Mac. It works better on the Mac but, still has some issues.  I tried adjusting the settings in the Logitech software app but nothing was working for me. In theory the MagSpeed feature is great, but this is what hinders me from giving this a 5 star review. Not to mention the premium price tag on it, you'd think Logitech would have everything figured out perfectly on it. Which is why I give this a 3 star review.

It also worked immediately on 20.04 Linux Mint.My one complaint is the texture on the buttons and on the palm grip area are absolute magnets for dirt. I like to think I wash my hands really well, but this thing makes me second guess that. The ridges on the wheel also pick up a lot of dirt. It's a small complaint, but it is the only one I have.",18-Mar-21

1240,Raymond G,4,"I will use it for all purpose especially for work.  The MX Master 3 is comfort, large size, high-quality and responsive buttons and wheels, and able to configure them for different Apps.  It has two short-comings, IMHO.  (1) It is higher than my old mouse so the wrist has to bend more.  Need a wrist-rest to be comfortable for long-time use.  (2) It does not have support for the 4th and 5th fingers to rest on.  My old mouse have places to rest 1st, 4th, and 5th fingers.  It is really comfortable when I have to use mouse for a day-long time.  As shown in the photo, I made a pinky-finger rest for my new MX Master 3 to prevent the fingers from rubbing the desktop when moving the mouse.  It was made with package tape and a piece of the black slippery sticky paper peered off from the bottom of the new mouse.UPDATE 3/29/21: it's heigher than normal mouse and I can not find a comfort way to hold it.  After have used for a while, my palm near the 5th finger hurts always after using the mouse for a while, since that side of the palm has to bend more inward which hurts the muscle by keeping it in tension.",16-Mar-21

1247,Michael,1,"I have had three of these mice (two older versions and this one) all of them have serious lag issues that just sort of happen for no reason. Both in the receiver and Bluetooth. It's so infuriating. They're expensive mice, but I 100% urge you to look elsewhere. I've tried all the forums and no one really has an answer. Not even Logitech. It seems they blame who ever built your computer and the computer manufactures blame Logitech.If your mouse suffers from stuttering or  lag... it may go away, but it will always come back. It's so bad I can't even do my job, so I had to go back to a $10 mouse. At least that actually works. Trust me - you're better off looking somewhere else, unless you want to play the stutter game with Logitech.",11-Mar-21
1248,amzcstmr,5,I use it with my work and personal macs.There are two very nice features that make me fully recommend it to other users.The extra buttons replace the trackpad gestures very well.The ability to sync with 3 different computers and switch between computers with the push of a button.,11-Mar-21
1249,Rocco Fantastic,4,"I love the ergonomics of this mouse.  I love the battery life.  I love the weight.  I love that I can have two different mice on the same dongle, and have three different devices per mouse.  I bought this one after also using their MX vertical mouse and finding that it seemed to work better over my finicky PCoIP work from home system than other wireless mice did.  Smoother, with fewer incidents of stuttering.I switch back and forth between this and the vertical mouse to keep my arm from getting sore throughout the day, which is why I like that they both can work with the same dongle.  I just grab the one I want and turn it on.  Or, if I want to use one with my laptop I just push the button on the bottom of either mouse to toggle it to a different device.The thing I don't like is the weird scroll wheel.  If you scroll it too quickly, it goes into some kind of hyper scroll mode.  The tactile feedback of the scroll wheel goes away and the wheel spins more freely.  I have never found it terribly useful, and more often than not it happens too late or at a weird time when I'm changing programs and something I don't want to be zooming or scrolling does just that- like a web page suddenly zooming out until I can't read anything or thumbnails shrinking away to nothing.  On my own computer I can turn that off using the Logitech drivers, which is cool, but on my company-managed linux box I'm stuck with default drivers, so the mouse does what it will.  I work around it, and it's obviously not too much of an issue, because I'm giving it four stars.  But I wish I could disable it permanently.As to the battery life- I don't think I have ever actually run the batteries down on either of my Logitech MX mice. I usually just think, ""man, have I charged my mouse at all in the last couple of months?"" and throw it on the charger before they ever run out. But maybe that's because I turn them off when I'm not using them.",9-Mar-21

1254,Justin,4,"Coming from using the Logitech Performance MX for several years (fav mouse of all time) I'm equally happy with and disappointed with the MX Master 3. I don't like the rubberized coating and the texture of the hard plastic. I don't like how sensitive the right mouse button is (it keeps triggering just from my sausage fingers resting on it).I do like the build, the side wheel, the thumb button and forward/back buttons. The middle wheel is nice except it doesn't handle successive rapid movements well on my machine (not sure if unique to mouse or my setup). Can't speak for battery life yet but I'm disappointed that it's non serviceable, at least without a screwdriver. Love that it's USB C.Tracking is good.Overall, it's a decent mouse but it feels more like it should be 70 instead of 100 bucks and the ergonomics of the Performance MX were better suited to my hands. Maybe I'll grow to love it. Otherwise I'm going to sell it and buy three more Performance MXs for the long haul.",4-Mar-21
1255,Layson Williams,4,"Love the functionality of the Master 3, and I adore the flow capability. Very responsive and accurate.Only drawback is the angle of holding it. Just a few more degrees would make this mouse shine in the light of ergonomics - not as steep as the MX Vertical, which takes it too far, but just a few degrees more than what the Master 3 already has.But if you're used to the dimensions of a typical mouse, the Master 3 is a wonderful addition.",3-Mar-21
1256,rk28,5,It was great until it completely stopped working for no apparent reason after 6 months.  Now the mouse will not charge or turn on at all.

1260,Nick Tassone,4,"Coming from a Logitech G9X (a weighted gaming mouse), the lightness of the mouse and tallness of the hand positioning took about a month to fully get used to. Now that I'm used to these things, the mouse is very comfortable for daily use but you definitely want to have a separate mouse for gaming. The clicks are definitely stiffer than the G9X (also another reason to keep a different mouse for gaming) but I don't notice it anymore.I almost bought the MX Master 3 Anywhere mouse instead because its smaller in the palm but now that I've given this a proper chance I'm used to it and love it.LOVE the 3 device switching ability. I have a Macbook Pro (using bluetooth), my PC (using the included logitech dongle) and my TV (bluetooth) mapped. The switching ability on the MX Master 3 and MX Keys is super smooth and convenient. Wish the button wasn't on the underside of the mouse though, I switch a lot and need to pick up the mouse every time, so that is an opportunity Logitech has for the MX Master 4.I don't like the side scrolling wheel position as it's awkwardly positioned for my thumb. There is also a slight lag to side scrolling initially. i'd prefer they kept that feature on the main wheel, that was great for me.The textured rubberized coating on where your thumb rests feels nice but is suspect, I've seen some users report it disintegrating and turning to a sticky mush over time, not sure if that is a rare defect or due to people cleaning their mouse with rubbing alcohol or something that hurts the finish. Hoping mine doesn't have that flaw with time, being careful not to get it dirty.Love the charging and battery life. I've owned it forover a month and use it everyday all day and haven't needed to charge it yet.I'd recommend it if you work from home or aren't gaming. Very solid if you give it a chance.",28-Feb-21
1261,Stephen J. Weber,5,"I was initially hesitant to purchase this mouse as my experience with Logi has been very, very inconsistent, however I needed a mouse for my home office that could hold up to 50+ hour work weeks and wouldn’t need replacement for several years. Since the media reviews as well as the reviews on here were extremely positive, I decided to chance it. A year later, I’m very, very glad I did. This may well be the last mouse you will ever need to buy. The angle at which you hold it make take some getting used to, as it is angled much less than some other ergonomic mice on the market, but it is comfortable to use for a ten-hour work day and definitely won’t go flying out of your hand accidentally. The internal battery will last you a good month, month and half at least if you power it off when not in use. The ability to pair to three devices is an awesome feature, and it works significantly better than I was expecting. The vertical scroll wheel is arguably this mouse’s party piece, and it is satisfying to watch it scroll for a good minute before the brake kicks in if you give it a good flick. If you really want to get the most you can out of this mouse, I would recommend installing Logi’s Logitech Options software as it offers some very nice customization options. That said, this is a solid mouse without the companion software, but the software adds a lot more value to it.",28-Feb-21
1262,Noah C,3,This mouse is great if you are looking for a wireless mouse. The scroll wheels are great.<br>The wired cable is only for charging and does not make this a wired mouse. Dealbreaker. Functions terribly on PC. Do not buy this for a PC.</br>,28-Feb-21

When I first got it, I honestly thought it was ergonomically pretty uncomfortable -- but after some time I got used to it and I do actually like it for the most part. The MX Master design is pretty great in general.The only thing that gets me about this mouse is the scroll wheel. I mean, the fact that it's metal/grippy and works electromagnetically is so cool -- but it does NOT map 1:1 with how much I spin it. I've honestly tried adjusting just about every setting and almost every mode kinda suffers from this -- I really think they missed the mark here. It's especially bad when rapidly switching scroll directions. I was hoping I would get used to it, and I sort of have, but it still upsets me even after a few weeks.",26-Feb-21

1270,SB,3,"This electromagnetic combo-wheel is awesome, and the side scrolling wheel works about 50% of the time.  The right-mouse button is overly sensitive and you cannot rest anything on it without false-clicks. And it still feels like cheap plastic.  I dunno what they could do to improve on that, but for 99 bucks, the false-clicks and lightweight feeling are underwhelming.At the current price-point, I would NOT say it is 3x better than my Logitech Marathon Mouse, for 30 bucks.And FYI, the side-scrolling wheel isn't supported by every app.  In fact a lot of them don't support it at all, and the ones that do vary wildly in their implementation.  Some will be slower than molasses to scroll left and right, while others like Excel are so hyper-fast, it is almost unusable.Sticking with my 3-star rating.It's a solid 4 if it were half the price.",22-Feb-21

1272,Mike Clark,5,"I bought the Logitech MX Master 3 mouse from a local office supply company in July of 2020, and it's one of the best computer accessory purchases I've ever made.I was debating between it and the Logitech MX Vertical, and ultimately decided against the Vertical because of limited features (no tiltable scroll wheel or alternative) and issues with being able to reliably click on either of the two buttons without pushing the mouse around, being able to hold down on the button and move the mouse around comfortably, etc.Without a doubt, the MX Master 3 is the absolute most comfortable mouse I've ever owned. It's also the fanciest, and I've owned mice from Apple, Kensington, and other manufacturers over the decades I've had a computer. It's super comfortable in my hand (I have decently-sized hands) and one of the best single features of it is the magnetic scroll wheel.My primary OS is Linux Mint, and so I was initially a little hesitant to drop about $100 on a mouse which may or may not be fully supported, since Logitech doesn't write software for GNU+Linux. On any platform, the only physical function which doesn't work without installed software is the ability to switch between multiple computers. Also, the magnetic scroll wheel works perfectly well, but you have no way to adjust when or if it switches between ratcheted and smooth scrolling. However, there's a program you can install from the repositories called ""Solaar"", and this enables you to do all the basic things, which includes battery level monitoring, connecting and disconnecting Logitech devices from a single unified Logitech USB receiver, and fully controlling the magnetic scroll wheel.One of the major touted features with the MX Master series is the ability to customize all the mouse shortcut functions and certain behaviors to do different things depending on which program you're actively using. That is, it can be customized to do certain things for ""just Photoshop"" and then swap this for other capabilities for ""just Illustrator"" and again for ""just MS Word"", and so on. I don't want to downplay any of that, but since I don't use any of those sorts of programs, I can't comment on how well that works. Solaar does not implement any of that functionality, so unfortunately I cannot replicate that in GNU+Linux.But, as I said at the top, this is the finest mouse I've owned, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.",21-Feb-21

You plug in the USB receiver to the computer, and the mouse connects without the need for Bluetooth.  That's great, but what if I'm not using that piece?  (I may use it, but rarely.)  I don't want to lose that very tiny USB receiver.  Here is my suggestion:Put a small slot for the very small USB receiver.  (I've seen it on other wireless mice.)

1301, ​,3,"Overall seems good.Scroll wheel is silent, which is great. But its scroll wheel is also quirky, and not always in a good way.If you spin its scroll wheel fast, it spins for an extremely long time (easily 10 full seconds). So you can scroll far with very little effort. But it also means that you constantly have to stop the wheel from spinning to avoid accidentally scrolling long after you originally meant to scroll. For example, dozens of times per day I found myself accidentally scrolled to the bottom of a page because I switched tabs after scrolling to the bottom of an earlier page. I'm sure I would have learned to use it better over time, but I gave it at least a week and it kept bothering me very frequently.Additionally, I often found the scroll wheel to behave poorly at short distances, which really annoyed me. In certain scenarios (I couldn't fully figure out when) it sort of just failed to scroll as far as it should. I think it was probably related to the automatic scroll mode switching. For example, maybe if you scroll a short distance too fast it mistakenly goes into its long-distance mode, which scrolls a shorter distance per wheel rotation. In any case, it was really annoying.",5-Feb-21

I needed a Bluetooth mouse for my new iPad, ergo I got this mouse.I listened to a reviewer who recommended the MX Master 3 with the Unifying Receiver rather than the Apple version of the same mouse--because it would function with Apple and yet include a USB dongle for other use.  He was absolutely correct--it still worked totally with the iPad and could work with my Windows PC with the USB Receiver.  So why get the Apple version only.My VX Revolution  has 10 programmable buttons, the VX Nano has 8 buttons, and this MX Master 3 has multiple programmable buttons as well, which was what attracted me.  The feel is good, and it is very easy to use, with greater precision--almost as precise as the corded Mouseman.I am able to switch between three devices, my Windows PC, the iPad and another.  Works out really well.  This $100 mouse is worth it.  Get a case to protect it.  I am using it more with my Windows PC than the iPad, what it was initially intended for.",26-Jan-21
1314,Sue,3,"You can connect to 3 PCs but the buttons on the bottom so reaching for another mouse is faster.You can map all kinds of thing to the different buttons but not the switching to different PCs. Seems crazy but ok. It's heavy and too tall to rest your hand on, hurts my hand forcing it to tilt to the right. So lifting it up and clicking the button on the bottom many times a day is not fun. The size and shape and weight force you to lift with your wrist and not your fingers so again picking up the front many times a day to keep tracking the mouse pointer in the same direction is not fun.This large heavy mouse has no place to store the USB (Not USB C) adaptor.Soft touch rubber will stain and not last long. Every mouse I've had with it peels at some point.Mouse wheel is nice idea but is randomly not seen by Windows and is quiet until it stops with a clunk.At least you can replace the batteries if Logitech still makes them by the time you need them and they don't cost more than the mouse.",26-Jan-21

The mouse's tracking will jump around constantly, especially when playing video games, and will lag sometimes.

1334,Swanson Stromboli,5,"This is by far the best mouse I have ever owned. When I saw the price tag initially I was a bit skeptical. How good can a wireless mouse possibly be, right? Boy was I wrong. I love the hybrid-ergonomic shape, very comfortable. It is a great starter mouse for someone like me who has used a standard mouse for their entire life and isn't ready to go fully sideways/ergonomic yet. The mouse wheel is absolutely gravity-defying. It is practically zero friction, it will just keep spinning and spinning! It makes scrolling on large webpages and excel documents so much easier. The wheel is completely silent too, which is nice. It also has excellent battery life. I have had to charge it 3 times in the 4 months I have owned it, and I probably could have waited longer in between. I don't use the customization features much, but I'm sure they are great for those who have use for them. My only complaint is that the Logitech program/drivers may cause some computer issues for some. For example, when I try to shut down my computer I sometimes get an error popup regarding the Logitech overlay still being active. There is also a Bluetooth-related part of the drivers/application that invisibly pops up on the computer at random times which can minimize and interrupt what I am currently doing, which can be frustrating. Overall I love this mouse, and would highly recommend it to everyone.",12-Jan-21
1335,DQ,4,"What really keeps this device from perfection though is the software side of things. The Logitech Options software is okay for customization, but it lacks certain features that makes no sense. By default the thumb resting button press is set to TASK VIEW, however when I want to customize the gestures I cannot select TASK VIEW as one of the options available.Also there is a bug probably in the current version that makes some of the buttons double click in every press, and this is very annoying cause the solution is to unpair and repair the mouse to windows.",12-Jan-21

I am lucky enough my company with provide these for me when I ask for them. I could ask for any brand or model and they would provide it, but I choose the MX Master 3 and MX Keys. I usually charge the mouse on the weekends, yes it lasts that long. The MX Keys needs charged twice a week since I leave the auto key illumination on. The feature I love most is being able to switch between three systems. Because you can connect via Bluetooth to your laptop, you can connect to multiple devices that have Bluetooth enabled. I have three laptops at my home office (COVID Protocol), my company laptop, my client’s provided laptop (I am contracted out to my client, so they provide a laptop to make working in their systems easier), and my personal laptop. The keyboard and mouse have a button labeled 1-2-3. Just select the one you want and go to work. I can swap on the fly when I need to.",10-Jan-21
1339,Nicholas Mirro,2,"Good luck getting smooth cursor movement and a reliable connection.  Millions of features are pointless if the connection endlessly breaks.The software has no connection related info so you are on your own.  I guess it would be pointless to add since when the connection weakens, you can't use the app anyway.One the PC processor goes under load, the connection weakens and the mouse is unpredictable.The forward back buttons are strangely too far back.  The most used ""back"" button requires you to slide your hand back from the resting position.Not sure what the battery light is saying.  Sometimes it's lit green, sometimes off.  No paper manual provided.Not sure what the forward button on the bottom means.

The MX 3 is no exception, it's the best one yet.Positives:* Easy to set up with nice configuration options.* Comfortable to use.* Moved the forward and back buttons back to under the horizontal scroll wheel. (So glad they moved back to this the location on the MX 2 was terrible)* Auto-magic switch between infinite and step scrolling. Loved this feature from the MX 2 and it's only been made better.* Uses USB-C now!* All metal scroll wheels. Easier to clean and don't show wear like MX 2. In addition the horizontal scroll while is bigger and easier to use.Cons:* Got rid of the battery charging status from MX 2. Now it's just a single LED, so it's harder to tell when fully charged.* Can't switch the computer the mouse is controlling from Logitech Options. (This should be added, it's so convenient with the MX Keys to do this.)* Could be slightly larger, this would improve the ergonomics for myself but likely hurt others.

1346,Jae Lee,2,"First, let me say that I love the Logitech's Keys (keyboard) with the MX Master 3 Mouse combo! It took a while to set up with my iMac and Windows 10 devices. There's some issues here but a quick update to the Logi Options firmware fixed the issue I was having with using Flow between my Mac and my work Windows PC. That being said, here is my review of just the mouse.The mouse was initially comfortable but I quickly realized that my ring and pinky finger were being curled in, which makes the comfort sub-par for me. I typically have ""medium"" sized hands (as gloves go) and this mouse is slightly too small for my liking. It's not a deal-breaker but I wish there was a bit more surface to the right of the mouse, like my previous trackball mouse which allowed me to put all my fingers comfortably on the mouse itself. Currently the right-side drops vertically so my 2 fingers have to curl in or just drag on the desk; both which are slightly uncomfortable, especially for long use.I've only been using this mouse since I busted it out of the box today but the build quality and matte finish are very nice. The scrollwheel is also a good as others have mentioned and spins nicely, allowing me to speed-scroll long pages.To Logitech - I would give this mouse a 5 out of 5 stars if it had more surface area on the right. Although it would make the mouse larger, it would greatly improve the comfort level for any users that have a medium or larger hand.So far so good. I'll update if anything changes but right now, I'm quite enjoying the Logitech keyboard and mouse combo.UPDATE:Too good to be true. While the initial switching option was nice, it's a bit buggy and I can't get it to work consistently and not sure what the issue is. So as of now, I'm having to switch manually using the buttons :(.UPDATE2:I haven't found any solution or update to solve the issue with flow not always working but a soft restart appears to help.UPDATE3:I may have found a ""better"" solution/setup. The mouse/keyboard is connected to the Windows PC via the Unifying Receiver and connected to the Mac via bluetooth, the switching/connectivity is consistently more stable. So far, its gone all day and works approximately 80% of the time. Still hope Logitech has an update to remedy this but so far so good...-ish.UPDATE 4:Been several months and I haven't had any success getting Flow to work again with my Mac/Windows PC setup. Even after numerous tries, restarts, uninstalls/reinstalls, and support community, nothing works. I've brought my rating as now it's nearly as inconvenient as having 2 sets of keyboard/mice. Quite unfortunate. As of this last update, if you want to pair Mac and a Windows PC, please take note.",5-Jan-21
1347,M.G.,2,"For reference, my hand size is 7.75 inches from wrist to middle finger, and 3.75 inches across at the point where the thumb meets the palm.I had the following problems with the Logitech MX Master 3It was too hard to grip –  other mice from Logitech and Microsoft have had a sticky rubber grip that I was subconsciously expecting here, but the MX Master 3's grip is different. It does have some kind of textured rubber, but it's harder to the touch, and didn't necessarily make grip easier for me.The other problem was the finger movement. The Logitech mouse I have is small enough that I use my middle finger for minor scroll wheel movements, but automatically switch to the index finger for more extended scrolling. This proved to be much more difficult due to the heft of the MX Master 3. I felt like I had to consciously make a choice to either keep scrolling with my middle finger, or make an explicit movement and switch to the index finger. Also, the thumb-based horizontal scroll, albeit optional, didn't really help much as scrolling with my thumb got painful fairly quickly.Hence, I returned this mouse. I really want to like it, but doesn't seem like it's the mouse for me.",5-Jan-21

The batter life is awesome on this thing, I have yet to charge it, and its been over a week of continuous use.  The best part is the the scroll button.  It can zip thru multiple pages with ease, or go line for line with precision.  Sure there are other cheaper mice you could buy, but if you want a quality product, with a name you can trust, this Logitech Mx Master 3 is the one for you.",4-Jan-21

1356,MN,5,"THE best mouse I ever owned, upgraded from a Mx Master.  Logitech took the same great ergonomics, but added distance between the left-right scroll wheel and the thumb rest (see pic), to avoid accidental scrolls.  New top wheel kinetics are great, the clicker is smoother now, plus, even in click mode, if you launch it fast, it will disengage the clicker and launch in inertial free spin mode.  Great to scroll long distances, no need to disengage the click anymore.  But the genius is, see my setup, the mouse can be paired with 3 different computers (including a mixture of PCs and Macs; see last picture, bottom button with 3 lights above it), and with the ""Flow"" technology, when scrolling to the edge of the left or right-most screen attached to one computer, it will seamlessly switch to the next computer.  So I can just swipe my mouse through my 6 screens (3 computers), in one movement.  Even better, I can copy from one computer and paste into another.  And I also bought the companion keyboard, see other review, as soon as I click on a text box in any computer, the keyboard links to that computer and allows me to type there.  Only 2 small niggles, 1) the ""gesture"" button under the thumb is a bit stiff and position sensitive, and 2) the keyboard only switches after you click in a text box, not when the mouse moves to the computer.  But the mouse is so vastly superior to everything else out there I have to give it 5 stars.  Gave it 4 for gaming because I just don't game.",2-Jan-21
1357,chivyguitar,1,"I've been a Logitech user for 20+ years. I always loved their gear. I was super excited to get this mouse to replace my trusty MX Pro mouse that recently developed issues with the primary button after about 8 years. This new mouse is a NIGHTMARE.<br>The awful SmartShift scroll wheel is impossible to use. One gently flick and I'm 100 pages down a document. It doesn't click or ratchet anymore, it constantly unlocks to smooth scrolling and I'm lost in my document. Scrolling is literally impossible now.I thought, ""no problem, there must be away to disable this useless crap."" So I installed the Logitech Options app, and yes it does disable that garbage. But it also replaces mousing and scrolling for the entire system. This has two huge drawbacks. One, I'm constantly nagged with permissions requests in macOS to allow this mouse to ""control my system"", which I granted, but the even bigger problem is once I set all the permissions to finally be correct, the mouse is still broken. If I zoom into the screen using Control+scroll wheel, an accessibility feature that I use constantly, the mouse suddenly has no idea where the cursor is anymore. And the scroll wheel doesn't work. It scrolls lists or windows that are nowhere near where my cursor is, and will not scroll what I'm hovering over. The app is completely broken in terms of knowing where the cursor is and scrolling whatever object is under the mouse cursor.I have no idea how this mouse has such high reviews. I guess I'm the only one that uses the screen zooming feature. The worst thing is, all of their new mice have this insane ""SmartShift electromagnetic scroll wheel"" gimicky crap. So now it looks like I can never buy another Logitech mouse again. I don't want to have to install an app to control how the scroll wheel works. These things always have bugs and stability issues. I just want a normal mouse with a normal scroll wheel.Good lord Logitech, why did you have to break something that was so good? Beyond frustrating. Now the hunt begins for a usable mouse. Ugh....</br>",1-Jan-21
1358,James Nordman,5,I ended up hating the Apple Magic Mouse 2 (most uncomfortable mouse I've ever used). This was its replacement. It has a decent weight which makes it flow well across the desk.

It has all the features I could want.,1-Jan-21

If you work with documents, or research on the internet, or work on more than one computer then you need to get this mouse.  This is not the gamer's mouse. This is a mouse for getting work done.  I use the customizable buttons on all the apps I use and it's awesome.  I fly through my work just by clicking buttons.  Everyone I show thinks it's magic that allows me to copy and paste, switch tabs, open new websites, turn up or down the volume, minimize windows, or switch desktops with my mouse.  Get this mouse.",30-Dec-20
1360,Stephan Knight,5,"I've had the MX Master 2, 2S and now the 3. There's a reason I keep coming back to this mouse. It's great for productivity. Every button is programmable and it has just enough buttons to be useful, but not so many that you'll forget which one does what. The ergonomics are much improved from the previous version.The construction of these mice is as good as mice come. It better be for the price. The texture is smooth with a subtle tooth to is so my hands rarely get sweaty when the gaming gets intense. Speaking of gaming, you can game on this mouse. It's a little on the heavy side but I've found the latency to be near zero for a wireless mouse so long as you stick to the dongle.Speaking of the dongle, the wireless reception can take some finessing. It can make it through your desk but I have found that it can suffer from interference if you have a computer or something in between the mouse and the dongle. Once you figure out your setup, it is as reliable as death &amp; taxes. The tracking on this mouse is absolutely perfect. It even tracks on glass and although the sensitivity appears to take a slight hit, it is probably imperceptible for most people.As I mentioned before, I've been using some variant of this mouse for the past 4-5 years. I have found that it is very comfortable and ergonomic. I never feel any fatigue after using it even if I find myself playing video games for extended sessions.  The scroll wheel is great with the two modes. I find the clicked mode is more practical in everyday use. When you spin it quickly, it unclicks and rolls smoothly, perfect for long pages, PDF's, or timelines in your video editing program of choice, this can be switched back &amp; forth on the fly.. While we're on the topic of configuration. every button can be changed to do whatever. I sort of wish there was one more button for the pinky, but that could screw up the ergonomics. The side scroll wheel on thumb is useful but not the most ergonomic. Not really sure how it can be improved as it its better than the previous version.Battery life is good, I don't find it annoying to plug it in about every 10 days to 2 weeks. The LED indicator let's you know at least 3-4 hours of constant use before you need to plug it in. I'll sometimes ignore the light and it'll keep chugging for another day.Lastly, it can be paired with multiple devices in one of two ways. Once you experience this level of convenience, you'll never want to go back. A simple button press on the bottom of the mouse (so you don't accidentally swap machines) and you are instantly paired with another machine. I use a PC workstation, a mac for work and an iPad as my laptop replacement. I have all 3 paired at once.Are you ready for the Caddy of wireless mice? You can't do much better than this guy.",30-Dec-20
1361,J. Wright,4,"Great mouse but Logitech's software for device switching is missing a key feature: you have to switch each device separately.So if you gave a Logitech keyboard like the K580 Ergo, you push a button to switch to device 2 AND you also have to pick up the mouse to separately switch the mouse to device 2.  It's not a huge deal but a use case that Logitech has really missed the mark to have truly great UX.",29-Dec-20

1364,Mike,2,"Do not trust the 4.5 stars this product has.Within 30 minutes of use I noticed issues when scrolling.  I thought it was an isolated issue, but a little searching shows this is a widespread recurring problem.  The mouse is unable to handle anything more than slow line by line speed.  Once you try to scroll several lines it lags and fails to register chunks of scrolls.  I am running this on a MacBook for reference.This is a total dealbreaker for anyone who plans to browse webpages, or documents.  From what I've seen, this is not being considered by Logitech as a bug to be fixed, but as a result of the hardware design, namely the new scroll wheel magnetic technology.  This is a huge disappointment, returning it right away.",28-Dec-20
1365,Rick Plavnicky,5,"This is an awesome mouse! I charged it when I installed it on December 3rd and it's been going strong since. (Today's December 28th) I spend way too much time on the computer - hey, I'm a workaholic and recreate with the box as well (if I'm not on the motorcycles - damned pandemic!) so every day's a long one. One of my hesitations about purchasing this mouse was the (stated) non-replaceable battery. But with cycles like this I can't see it wearing out all that soon. What's more, since Logitech provide instructions on LiPo battery recycling I wouldn't be surprised if a replacement can be sourced from a third-party when that becomes necessary. I came from a Logitech Performance MX so getting used to this mouse was a snap. The all-steel scroll wheel feels every bit as good as you might think it is, the electromagnetic detent system is just great, and already I can tell I'd sorely miss the side-scroll wheel if it were gone. All buttons are crisp and precise. Tracking is accurate and perfect on my glass desk. I'm using this with the dongle as opposed to Bluetooth so can't comment on that or tell you if using Bluetooth impact battery life. Likewise, I haven't tried using this mouse to control multiple computers at once, either. I dinged the mouse for gaming because - while I'm not a gamer - I realize that wireless mice as a whole are just too unresponsive for most gamers. Finally, the price. It's high. Worth it to me, though, for reasons given. Plus, it's Logitech - built like a tank and in my experience, they stand behind their gear. My Performance MX lasted more than 7 years.Edited to add that today, January 2, 2021, I received an alert that the mouse battery charge had dipped to 'critical' levels. One day short of a month of heavy use is double-plus excellent in my book.",28-Dec-20

1367,R. Ross,1,I have been an avid fan of MX Master mice for years.  I still have an MX Master 1 that is amazing but started having microswitch issues after years of service.  This new one is horrendous.  The mouse wheel doesn't work after a couple scrolls.  Seems like it cannot decide whether you're going to be doing a fly-wheel scroll or a regular one and gives up doing either.  Basically unusable and going back.  I don't know what happened to Logitech.  First the Harmony has gone completely off the deep end.  Now their flagship mouse too?,27-Dec-20
1368,Juan Diego Pinillos,1,"I have to change my previous review of this item due to not working as intended... in fact, it doesn't work at all.It started with random disconnections, then it stopped working wirelessly, I changed drivers, tested on a different computer with no effect, the only way it kept working was plugged to the included cable but after just a couple of weeks it stopped working altogether, not connecting ever again.I tried to contact Logitech support and it was awful, you will not get a complete refund unless you leave on the US... avoid like the plague",26-Dec-20
1369,Anna,5,"As a programmer, I've been using the MX series since it first came out over a decade ago. I get a new mouse and mech keyboard (Das Keyboard) every year for Christmas (it's a thing for me) so this more than my tenth MX series mouse. It's all I use.Admittedly, I've owned this particular variation for only a day, but I see none of the problems some people here are complaining about. To me, so far, it's every bit as good as the MX carnations before it.  It feels better than the 2S (which this one is replacing) and the forward/back buttons are greatly improved over the 2S (I really hated those). The wheels work well, and feel heavier.So this is a vastly improved model from what I can tell. Rest assured, if I experience problems with it, I will be back immediately to edit this review. I don't know why people are experiencing these problems, perhaps a bad batch got out? I don't know.Is there a better mouse out there (at least for programmers)? I doubt it.",26-Dec-20

1372,Syed Mehdi,3,"I bought this mouse after reading several good reviews. To be honest, I like the mouse. It has compatibility with both Mac and Windows with several pre-programmed profiles. It’s ergonomic. Build Quality is very good. The only reason I gave it a 3 star was due to serious lag issues due to Bluetooth technology used in the unifying receiver (dongle). I don’t use it for gaming. But I would imagine that it would be an even bigger frustration for gamers.I was trying to open several email attachments. However, the lag and freeze of the mouse were so bad that it took me 10 mins just to click on 9 email attachments and download. And it was a time sensitive work email that I had to respond to. I was so frustrated that I was about to chuck the mouse at the monitor screen. Instead, I just ordered a Logitech G502 “Wired” mouse today on Amazon on sale for $40. Expecting to receive it in the next couple of days.",25-Dec-20

It stopped working while I was taking the midterm exam for my graduate program. It is really great product in Mac OS. However, on the Windows, the experience was not the same. I tried to search for the solution online but there wasn't much troubleshooting procedures I could follow. I know the bluetooth can be flaky in Windows. However, I also bought a Keychron keyboard, which runs on bluetooth. I use both devices for my Macbook Pro and my Windows Desktop. It is the only the mouse that is having a problem with Windows. :( If there can be any solution to this, it would be fantastic.",24-Dec-20

1377,Amazoncustomer,5,"Picked this mouse up as soon as it was first released in September 2019 and have absolutely loved it ever since. The battery lasts forever, even with regular 40 hour a week use (about 3 months between charges). The button placement is all comfortable enough and feels so much nicer than cheap default mice in the hand. The left and right click are a little louder than I was hoping but it's not too much of a deal breaker. The advanced scroll wheel is very useful, so much so that I have a hard time using regular mice for any period of time since the free scrolling feature is very convenient, especially on win10 with Word documents.I use the three device feature very frequently, between personal computers and a work laptop while working from home. The Options software is great for expanding the usage of the mouse, especially reassigning functions or keypresses on the mouse, all on a per-program basis. Some light keyboard/mouse gaming is great with Options and this mouse to assign specific keypresses depending on the game.My work laptop doesn't allow for use of the Options software but despite that this mouse is still absolutely stellar for daily use. Sure, I can't use Options to allow me to use the side scroll wheel on Excel but that's not too big of a deal for me.Great mouse through and through, so much so that after using it for a year I decided to get MX Keys and the two together are amazing for work and personal use.Can't recommend this one enough. Just get it.",23-Dec-20
1378,sid,5,Very good mouse - ergonomic and long lasting battery.  Thumb-roller thing and other buttons appear to not function and there are no instructions on how to program them.  Very surprised that Logitech advertises the programmability of these devices (same for MX KEYS keyboard) but does not provide instructions for such programming.  Their links only go to sales promotions - not instructions.  Shame on Logitech.  Good mouse if you can afford it - it's overpriced.,23-Dec-20
1379,HaSNoLo,5,"Logitech used to sell larger mice with their keyboard and mouse bundles.  I have several older mice that fit great in my hand but are aging.  The newer mice that came with my most recent bundle purchases are too small for my hand and start to hurt after a while.  I don’t have carpal tunnel but am almost there due to many years of working on computers.  This mouse is exactly what I was looking for, it’s better for larger hands, it’s very smooth, has all of the buttons of a higher end mouse, and it connects via Bluetooth or Unifying Receiver.  I like the USB Unifying Receiver because I keep it plugged into a docking station that I use for 2 different laptops and they both recognize the mouse immediately after I plug in.  I also like the fact that it charges via USB rather than rechargeable batteries.  The only issue here is the price tag but should be worth it considering how long Logitech products last.",23-Dec-20

1388,Bill Fowler,4,"I bought this one after giving up on my MX Vertical mouse, which was comfy but tends to get in the way and get knocked over on my desk a lot.I use my MX Master 3 with MacBook Pro (Big Sur) and also in Windows 10 via Parallels 16 virtual machine. My desktop is white laminate. No problems there. No issues with bluetooth connection or battery life. I don't use the USB. And I haven't been throwing it into my backpack to work remotely since the COVID lockdown. At least it's more portable than MX Vertical.I don't do gaming but I do a lot of architectural modeling with Revit. Precise control of the cursor and scroll wheel are essential. For me, the MX doesn't offer enough adjustment for the scroll wheel speed nor acceleration. In fact I had to uninstall the Logi software because the settings didn't have the same results in Mac and Win apps. Whether this is a Logi problem or Parallels, I don't know. It helps to simply use the Windows and Mac internal mouse drivers. So maybe their software could use improving?Ergonomically, it fits my average size male adult hand very well but I find the right button too easy to trigger by mistake. Tactile feedback seems better for left-click than right-click.I like the tactile feedback of the scroll wheel - and the smooth scroll feature. I don't use the additional wheel next to my thumb, nor the two adjacent buttons.Overall, it's pretty decent hardware. I think the biggest issue is Logi software.Hope this helps.",16-Dec-20
1389,skinny01,5,"I had the original MX master and thoroughly wore that out, somehow ended up with a hole that kept growing near where the thumb sits so figured it was time for an upgrade.This one is just as good, nice metal scroll wheels feel more high end.  Ergonomics are perfect.I've been spoiled using logitechs for the past 20 years or so exclusively and had to use a crappy work mouse recently and that just helped me confirm why I need to stick with the logitechs ,they're the best.This one has a nice matte finish on it, just a subtle texture.It glides really easy.  Thumbs up all around.I use it for precise mouse work, illustrator, photoshop stuff and it has just the right weight to move easily, but not too flimsy where you throw it around too much like the cheapo mice.",16-Dec-20
1390,ManGop,1,"I didn't buy from Amazon. But I wanted people to know that the horizontal scroll does not work 50% of the time. It is stupidly intermittent for no apparent reason. It's possibly a software bug because it starts to work when you scroll manually. I bought this mouse ONLY for horizontal scroll but now I'm terribly disappointed. Raised the issue with Logitech to no avail, but learned that this is a widespread issue. It's possible that many don't notice it, because they don't use horizontal scroll often. If you need horizontal scroll, look away, DONT BUY THIS MOUSE.",15-Dec-20

The horizontal wheel is also great for those long spreadsheets you need to scroll horizontally. I don't use it for gaming, but for desktop work, it's fantastic.The battery life is incredible.

I'm not a gamer and mostly use my PCs for running relatively standard office apps, specialized financial apps, managing my music and photo libraries, email, and surfing the Web. I recently purchased this mouse for use with my nearly ""new"" 2019 27"" iMac, running Mac OS 11 (""Big Sur""). The mouse seems fine 80-90% of the time but periodically freezes up until I pick it up and fiddle with it. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the device, yet the issues quickly reappear. At least for now, I've put it away and reverted to my Apple ""Magic Mouse,"" which doesn't display the same issues. Until I encounter a definite need I will probably stick with the Apple mouse because, as they say in the commercials, ""It just works.""

Even the middle mouse button does not register! Now you're thinking, well just assign them keystrokes. I thought the same... that doesn't work either.

To solve this, I downloaded Logitech's control center software. The software gives no help on pairing the device. I have my mouse paired to my computer AND plugged in with the USB dongle. Still, the software says it's unable to find any Logitech devices. It's pretty bad when their own software can't even recognize their own devices. Naturally, Logitech's documentation online is abysmal, and so far after an hour of research, my buttons still don't work! For such an expensive mouse, this is a really terrible user experience.

1404,LarrytheLobster,2,"This was a wonderful mouse when it still worked.When you pick it up for the first time, you can really feel the eloquence of the MX Master 3. Using it as a productivity tool is a dream and you can easily tell how much effort Logitech put into the R&amp;D of this mouse. So it’s really unfortunate that I have to write this and discourage others from buying it.Like some commenters have already expressed, there’s a defect with the magspeed scroll wheel that Logitech seemingly does not want to address. After using it for a little under a year, the scroll wheel started to get a bit loose and make an acute grating noise with each flick. This was only noticeable in ‘ratchet mode,’ but unfortunately that’s the only mode I use the mouse on. I reached out to Logitech customer service hoping to get a replacement since it was under their 1 year warranty.After talking with a rep and even sending them a video of the issue, they wrote back and said that it was not enough evidence provided to move forward with my claim. This was really surprising as I did not expect to get push back from a company as large as Logitech when there’s video evidence of the issue of their product.I bought this very early in its release and unfortunately I did not listen to the warnings other users gave. This is a great mouse, but it’s just not durable... for $100, I would have hoped that it would last me longer than a year. If you’re in the market for a mouse, I would stay away from the MX Master 3, or maybe even Logitech as a company...",8-Dec-20

I wish there was a better rating system or quality control on Bluetooth adapters. Reviews are deceiving, my first adaptor got good reviews as well.Old:It connects via Bluetooth straight away, but disconnects often.  I have to disable and re-enable my Bluetooth to get it to connect and work again.  Which means I have to keep a second mouse connected just so that I can reconnect this mouse when it fails.  I don't think it's worth it!!!!!  A mouse is only good if it actually works.I read one that said to disable the logitech download assistant which is loaded as a device.  When you do this the middle button no longer works - so for me that is not a solution.

However, I found that it only works about 80% of the time.  The other 20%, you have to manually switch.  Why is the switch at the bottom of the mouse?  You now need to pick up the mouse and turn it over to switch it. I am constantly switching between the 2 PCs, so this is a hassle I don't want to deal with.  At least they could have included software to relocate the button.  If switching worked 95% of the time and the switch button was on top, I would give it 5 stars.",8-Dec-20

That alone is pretty incredible, but the scroll wheel is so satisfying that switching to any other mouse is so jarring. The rubberized finish is very comfortable, and definitely feels premium in a way that's hard to describe. This is not a gaming mouse by any means, nor was it intended to serve that function. It's too heavy for FPS titles, and the software is not geared towards gamers in any way. I intend on updating this review in a year or two if the battery life drastically decreases, but I consider this to be the best daily driver mouse for everyone that isn't primarily looking for something gaming-oriented. $100 is quite pricey, but if it lasts, then it's well worth the money.",3-Dec-20

I have the two thumb ones programed to copy and paste which saves so much time moving around notes and text. You can even program them to do different stuff in different apps. I use anki (Flashcard program)  a-lot, specifically the cloze cards. So I have a button that I programed to do the key stokes to ""cloze"" a piece of text when using the anki app. But it will do the normal function I programed in all other apps.<br>I saw some people online say they didn't like how big and chunky it was and that it felt too big for their hand. but I have had no problem with that. (With my average sized female hands) Feels perfect to me, so maybe just a preference thing.Don't know anything about gaming so no idea how it works in that department!Only critique is that I feel like the sliding/switching windows gesture is not as smooth as I would wish. But it still works fine. I would also love to see them add a zoom wheel on the next version, but again, totally fine with out one. I just use my magic mouse pad for zooming into stuff.Anyways, 100$ is super expensive for a mouse, but its a solid buy if you are into having extra nice office gadgets with cool features!

This is true even when I disable the ""smart switch"" feature, and try to mess with other settings. This erases pretty much all other advantages of the scrollwheel and mouse, because an unreliable scrollwheel is just maddening.I think Logitech tried hard here, but the tech isn't ready for prime-time.

1421,Shintsu,2,"I expected this mouse to be great, as someone who has used Logitech mice forever. I have been using a wired G502 for years and wanted to go bluetooth, so this seemed like a good one to go for on my work computer. Problem is, this mouse's features apparently only work if you have the Logitech software. If you work for any competent org, installing third party software is a no go, thus I cannot install the Logitech software for this which controls all the functions of this mouse.On the very old G502, it has on board memory so you can set it on another computer and it retains the programming. I assumed it was a given this was a feature of the MX Master. It is not. It does not remember the sensitivity, programming, or anything from computer to computer (I put the software on my personal computer). Even after that software was installed, the gestures did not work, the horizontal scrolling did nothing anywhere I used it.Ergonomically, the mouse feels too tall. The scroll wheel has a weird electronic braking system that changes on the fly if it's click detent or free spinning which seems highly prone to failure. The forward/back buttons are very hard to press with the thumb. And the mouse feels way too heavy, and I usually never cared that much about the weight of a mouse.For the price I expected way better. I would not be happy with this at even half the price. Returning to get a wireless gaming mouse that retains the settings with onboard memory. Buyer beware on the MX Master.",1-Dec-20

The only way to get it to stop lagging was to plug it in with the wire. I'm assuming the bluetooth software for it is bad.",24-Nov-20

1435,Delinquent,4,"This mouse replaced the Logitech Performance MX that I had for many years. I don’t understand why Logitech would remove one programmable button in a new model like the MX Master 3, and also make the product less ergonomic.Now the MX Master 3 is fine enough, better than the competition. Mac owners should be aware that to program the buttons requires you to go to the Security preferences of the Mac OS and grant the Logitech Options permission to allow the programming. There is zero mention of this in the written materials and on-line, which makes me wonder if Logitech uses their own products. The good news is that the on-line product support chat rep figured this out, though it took a half hour of playing 20 questions to get there.The battery life of this mouse is significantly improved over the MX and that is what’s keeping the product on my desk instead of my ordering a same-priced unopened  MX. But I may still do that. . . .",20-Nov-20

1438,Rick Lowe,5,"I have carpal tunnel from working with mice in the IT Industry for years. I researched and found that this could (and later would) be a solution for my aching hands.1. It fits great in your palm, the ergonomics are fantastic.2. Works great on Mac, never had a problem where it didn't immediately connect to my Mac Device on boot. Even when I had a software upgrade to Big Sur, recognized it immediately. Didn't have to worry about having to find a wired mouse to connect to my CPU to get past the login screen at all.3. The scroll wheel on top can be adjusted via the Logi Options application to increase or decrease the scroll speed. Also, if you can unlock the click detent by pressing on the button behind the wheel. I hate detents when I scroll, so a freewheeling scroll wheel does away with the annoying clicking sound as you scroll back and forth.Notes:To really support your wrists, get a Belkin mouse pad with wrist rest and place it down, put the mouse on it to operate. Your wrists will thank you.Logi Options application needs to be downloaded from the web. Make sure it is the Mac version. Once you install go to your security settings and all the Logitech application to control your mouse. This allows all the customization functions, and there are many, to work with many 3rd party applications. You will learn all about this in the Logitech application.",18-Nov-20

Unfortunately, (and it doesn't say this in the docs anywhere) unlike the old Logitech system, the left and right switches on the top, which I had programmed the left as ""single click"" and the right as ""double click"", cannot be programmed.

I upgraded to this Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse based on a recommendation from a reputable computer company (System 76). The mouse fits my hand comfortably, is very smooth to use, and provides the optimal tactile response as far as buttons and scrolling. I use this mouse with a gel wrist pad and leather mouse pad.I also upgraded my keyboard from a Logitech K710 to an MX Keys Advanced Wireless Keyboard (and Logitech wrist pad for thin keyboards), and am also pleasantly surprised with the keyboard's solid metal construction, smooth and well-defined key response, and smart back lighting. Both the keyboard and mouse use a USB-C connected re-chargeable battery; haven't had them long enough to determine time between recharges.Both items were purchased as separate orders from Amazon direct (Amazon.com Services LLC), and both arrived on-time and in perfect condition.",17-Nov-20

1445,Skip,2,"Ive had a MX master for several years and its a game changer. I love the mouse, have a travel case, and cant imagine using anything else. My issue comes from the fact that the dongle quit working out of nowhere and the bluetooth has to be reset almost everytime I use it. Luckily it pairs quickly but its annoying. It does stay charged forever and I probably only do it once every three months. Anyways, I am considering getting newest model to see if connections are fixed. The fact that its not usb-c boggles my mind though.",15-Nov-20
1446,Trav,5,"Coming from a standard wired mouse this was the perfect upgrade. I understand that those upgrading from prior versions may have their gripes and therefore provide a negative review, but trust me, do not let them allow you to miss out on this beauty.Connecting to the three devices via Bluetooth was a breeze, and switching between them is very simple. It does take some getting use to lifting and clicking, but not bad.I use Visual Studio Code a lot and was able to set the buttons to app specific shortcuts and that has been a navigation game changer.I personally would not recommend it for gaming, but you can set one of the buttons to change the dpi “similar” to the G502. I haven’t tested that yet but I did see the option.Finally the software is very user friendly and the scroll wheel is amazing. So if you are upgrading from a standard mouse I would highly recommend this mouse.",14-Nov-20

1450,Young Amazoneer,5,"Best mouse I have ever used. I use the mouse on ble and Mac in clamshell mode, and use this mouse along with a touch pad, ble headphones, and ble keyboard daily. Only quirk is that it cannot be used right when you turn your Mac on from being powered off (I think because ble is turned on only after your user is logged in), so now I just keep my Mac in sleep mode. Logitech also has an app that updates your mouse and loads custom profiles that customize what the side buttons do in different apps which is pretty sweet.",12-Nov-20

1452,Jer1my,5,"Much more ergonomic than the MX anywhere (probably obviously). That extra space for ergonomics allows for the space needed for some extra buttons and wheels that are completely customizable. Works beautifully on my macbook pro. I did misunderstand the gesture button at first though, I thought it was intended to be used like a magic mouse where you swipe on the little marker on the mouse itself, but the intended use, is to press the button while gesturing with the mouse, so mac users be aware of that, or like me you'll think the gestures aren't working LOL ;)",12-Nov-20

1454,Deborah Kohlin,5,"This mouse feels and works great. I transitioned from the Logitech MK550 so it’s definitely an improvement in ergonomics. The shape feels natural especially for a palm gripper like myself. I like that the right side is not pinched in like other devices so I don’t add strain to my ring and pinky fingers from pinching inward. The size is perfect for my medium sized hands as well. My really like the texture of the mouse. It’s not the standard super smooth plastic that most mouses are made with. The buttons are somewhat textured so your fingers grip them better and the whole palm section has a slight rubberized feeling. I especially like the thumb groove that has an obvious texture that not only looks neat, it feels nice. My favorite additions to this mouse are the forward/backward buttons and the left/right scroll. The scrolling wheel is super fast which a bit odd to get used to but it has a nice feel and it isn’t noisy like my old mouse, so that’s awesome. If you frequently do work in drafting/sketching programs like I do, you’ll definitely benefit from having a comfortable and efficient mouse like this one.",3-Nov-20

1466,David,3,"I read all the reviews and was really excited about getting this mouse, but ended up returning it after trying it out for 4 days.  I just couldn't get used to the size and way it felt in my hand.  My wrist also started hurting by day 3 after normal usage, which would only happen after VERY extended work sessions with my previous mouse.  I also hated the highly touted mouse wheel sensitive shift, or whatever it was they call it...Whenever I tried using the wheel, it just felt inaccurate and really laggy.  I played around with the settings quite a bit as well, trying pretty much every combination to make it work.  I REALLY wanted to like this mouse!  But after 4 days, I'm officially giving up on it.  I know it can take a few days to get used to a new mouse, but after switching back to my old one for a quick minute, I just don't see the point of suffering any longer.I don't doubt this is a perfectly good mouse for some people.  I'm sure some people absolutely love it.  It just wasn't for me...",29-Oct-20

I love the accelerometer function so I can spin it slowely and the screen moves almost pixel by pixel and as I start spinning it faster, the screen moves much faster. It's much more precise than Apple's Magic Mouse 2 that I had been using. The Logitech driver/app seems to work seemlessly and I can program special functions in Photoshop that work with the extra keys and side wheel on the mouse. So far this is terrific.",28-Oct-20

But only if they connect to your computer. Some days they do. More often they do not. I recently had a delightful stretch of about 8 days where they both remained connected and I love them. Then yesterday, nothing. Can't reconnect. Can't repair. Tried everything Logitech suggested (e.g., battery life, reinstalling LogiOptions, etc). -- nothing. Right now, both are unusable. I don't know if Apple changed something or if Logitech did, but a 50-50  connectivity likelihood has now dropped to 0-100 and I cannot devote more than 2 hours in a day to trying to connect my mouse and keyboard. I hate the result but have to tell the truth -- they are now both unusable. I will try again in a few weeks and hopefully somebody has updated the software on device or laptop to fix this problem. (and to prove the point, it happens on two different laptops so I know its not a problem with one of them). Logitech: HELP!",28-Oct-20

This mouse can be used for gaming, but personally its too heavy for my liking. I like a very light mouse for fast paced games like FPS's. If you are a casual gamer, this is just fine and I did use it for a short time with no issues. Overall I have used this mouse for months, I do not regret paying the price.

It's really comfortable to use, and all the extra programmable buttons really make a difference, though it takes some time to adjust to using these instead of doing what you would normally do. The biggest difference is the infinite scroll wheel, it makes scrolling through pages is so effortless.

1489,Amazon Customer,1,"I am a graphics designer and a photographer, so I went for this mouse the second I saw it advertised, since it's supposedly made specifically for Macs.<br>This mouse is horrendous. The Bluetooth connection abilities this mouse has in 2020 reminds me those days where Bluetooth started to appear in the scene.The main issue is that his mouse totally disrupts the Bluetooth connection on the mac. So, if I connect it directly to the Mac Bluetooth, it randomly drops, but it brings down every other thing that is connected to the Mac's Bluetooth... This lasts for around 30 seconds, and then everything comes back again to normal.This happens constantly. Randomly.Now, if I connect it to the Unifier (The Bluetooth Dongle that comes with the mouse), then the defect changes a bit. The randomness persists, but this time it doesn't drops, instead it jitters, have weird hiccups where the mouse stutters for around 30 seconds and then comes back to normal. In this case, the Mac Bluetooth is not affected and everything else keeps working just fine.It's extremely annoying to be working and having to randomly wait for 30 seconds for the thing to come back. Or having it stutter all over the place.Don't buy it. I've been in contact with Logitec for two months now, and they have no idea of what is going on with this item. They want me to return it and get a new one... that's after weeks dealing with them.Awful product</br>",15-Oct-20

Ive never had issues with the Logitech mice/keyboard combos I buy; this was no exception.It is the top of the line productivity and art mouse for this form-factor.  It is ergonomic and large enough for my hands.  The finish feels great, smooth and comfortable, yet grippy enough that it feels secured under your hand without holding tight at all. Aesthetically it looks fantastic, matches the MX Keys, obviously and they match myPD2700U DesignVue Designer Monitor perfectly, especially for a minimalist desk setup.As a digital artist/photographer I recommend this mouse for the enthusiasts who can afford the premium price to the professionals looking for an upgrade.",12-Oct-20
1492,dylan,3,"Let me start by saying that I am somewhat of a Logitech mouse fan boy. By far, I have yet to find a mouse that comes close to Logitech in terms of price and quality. I've owned an MX Master 2s for over 3 years and recently picked up a G305 for gaming purposes. I needed a new workstation mouse since after 3 years of use and abuse, the soft rubber exterior was starting to deteriorate.I really wanted to love the MX Master 3, the new scroll wheels are noticeably better than its predecessor, and I think it looks better as well. I wasn't crazy about the new shape of it (your palm will sit at about a 30 degree angle rather than flat.) but that was not a deal breaker to me.What was a deal breaker however was the terrible friction of the mousepads on the mouse. One of the things I love about my other Logitech mice is that they feel completely frictionless. The MX Master 3 was more comparable to a $20 mouse, which is a shame, since I truly liked the rework of the scroll wheels and buttons on the mouse. I'd like to believe that maybe my mouse is just defective, but based on some other reviews, I don't think that's the case. If you're looking for the ultimate workstation mouse, I'd save yourself 20 bucks and go with this mouse's predecessor. I hope in a future release they can fix this problem and keep the new scroll wheels, that'd be awesome!",12-Oct-20
1493,Michelle Bradbury,4,"I was so excited to get this and try out all of the features.  Unfortunately, it actually became painful to use because I learned I have ""small hands"".  My husband is using it now and loves it.  Wish it came in different sizes like some other brands.",11-Oct-20
1494,Tim,3,"After returning one and getting a second one with the same issue, I now believe that this mouse has a design flaw. When scrolling with the main mouse scroll wheel while it is in 'click' mode, scrolling up fast causes a slipping, making it frustratingly difficult to scroll quickly to the top of a long page. while spinning the wheel up, the page just sticks for moments then continues up a bit, then sticks again. Pretty frustrating and amazing that this snuck by their quality control. It works relatively well with the wheel in smooth-scroll mode so if that's the mode you prefer anyway, you might be fine with this mouse. I do enjoy the ergonomics (seems that it would be good for big hands as well as small) and it's cool that you can control 3 different computers with it and the programmable buttons are great. But for $100, the mouse needs to at least cover the basics well, and that scrolling issue is a deal breaker for me.",11-Oct-20
1495,RB601,3,"As of this morning, 7 days past Amazon's return window, this mouse started malfunctioning. The cursor jumps around randomly, quivers back and forth in one spot, ""phantom clicks"" things so things start opening by themselves, won't allow me to click on something as nothing happens when I do click, and the cursor resizes randomly as well, like it's magnified. The feel of the mouse is great and it's more accurate and faster, but it's rendered useless when this malfunction occurs. Amazon, of course, said ""too bad pal - contact Logitech"" and I will do that, but I anticipate little to no help from that giant corporation. We'll see. If I connect a corded USB mouse to the computer and use it, the MX3 starts working as it should again.",11-Oct-20
1496,Peter Neaman,1,"One of the outstanding qualities of the MX Master 2 was the ability to assign your own choice of functions to various parts you can press (wheel, moe button, etc.). This ability has been radically degraded in the MX M3 by substituting a bunch of Logitech-chosen! shortcuts specific to apps (e.g., Photoshop, Word) that are easily done, often with single keystrokes and CRIPPLED your chosen function assignment by requiring you to MOVE the mouse AFTER you press--for many uses totally eliminating the desired action. PRIME EXAMPLE: Custom assigned double-click WILL NOT WORK in dialog boxes and for other important needs. It's BACK TO THE MX M2 for sure.

I bought this one to replace an MX Master 2S (also spent $ 100 on that one).  It is a huge improvement over the 2S simply because the 2S's forward and back buttons are scratching your thumb all the time.But, not this one, not the 2S or the previous one I forgot the name hold a candle to the Logitech MX Revolution [bluetooth].  I have both on my desk all the time, like right now, and all the time I start using the MX Master 3 and end up switching to the 10+year old Revolution.Not only it is a better mouse, the wheel tilts to the sides and is more comfortable, but how can a mouse with electromechanical parts last over 10 years?The quality of the MX Master 3 is great, not as good as the old ones, and the wheel doesn't tilt to the sides thats quite bad. The brichures don't mention that.If you can get ahold of an archaic MX Revolution in good shape, you will be better off.  I guess thats why they run up to $ 200 each :/",8-Oct-20

1503,TatteredKing,5,"Bought this for my work machine and am so spoiled by it I just bought a 2nd one for my gaming laptop. Solid feel and the scroll wheel has to be experienced to understand why it's perfect. Really interesting magnetic clutch in there that gives you fine control and a ""fast flick"" spin that can zoom through to the end of a document almost instantly. Some really useful side-scrolling and other features as well. Highly recommend.",8-Oct-20
1504,Dustin Schneider,2,"What an epic design failure. Received the mouse, paired it with my main computer and the other 2 downloaded the software and went looking for a button to switch from device to device. Guess what? The switch button is on the bottom of the mouse, if you want to switch from device to device you have to lift and push a small button each time. This is the worst design ever. Imagine working on 2 pc's and wanting to swap between them well you can't unless you stop pick it up and push a button. Who the hell does this?  Flow?? Well that doesn't work when you have a work computer not on the same network. All in all it is a major disappointment.",7-Oct-20

1506,Arthur P,4,"I was looking for a new mouse for my at home office set up, and have always went with Logitech for my needs. Have owned various mice from low end to high end, these were tough to find in stock at the time of purchase and are pretty pricy. I work in the architecture space drawing plans in 2d/3d, the more comfortable and efficient that a mouse can be is definitely a plus. So after seeing reviews on the multi task features and versatility I decided to buy it. In the past I  have used a Performance MX mouse and thought it may be an upgrade.After receiving it I was impressed with the feel and functionality. Very quick to set up and having Bluetooth is a huge plus as you don’t have to worry about a usb connection. However, after a few days I found it to be to bulky for me and I kept accidentally clicking the back button. Changing it in settings to have that button be no function didn’t help. It unfortunately wasn’t as ergonomic as expected and needs a few redesign touches, I ended up returning. Purchased the Performance MX instead, much more comfortable mouse for me, it may not have all the fancy bells and whistles but comfort is my #1 concern for a mouse.Overall Master 3, recommended for people with larger hands but not really great for users with average size hands.",6-Oct-20

1511,Stephanie B,5,"I bought this mouse for work about a year ago and have maybe charged it 4 times. It’s absolutely incredible how long this mouse can go without even getting low on battery.

I would highly recommend this mouse for anyone looking for a top notch daily driver.",2-Oct-20

1513,brian,1,"After just 20 minutes of use, the side buttons started malfunctioning. Any action you assign to the side buttons, are doubled. No matter if you jus let press once. I bought this so I could copy and paste to reduce time for work and now it takes more time to delete the double pasted item than it does just to copy and paste via the keyboard. Apparently this is a known problem as multiple forums have mentioned this. I am disappointed...",30-Sep-20
1514,Zhaot,5,This ergonomic design is by far the most comfortable mouse I've used. The feel is great and pointing is extremely smooth specially for gaming. I also love the wheel actions as well as all the customized actions that can be programmed. I don't have experience with battery life but I've only charged it once since I bought it which is couple of months ago.We bought a second mouse for my partner since we loved it so much.,30-Sep-20
1515,Cody E.,5,My favorite part of using this mouse has to be its capability of switching seamlessly from one computer to another. It's especially useful when using my laptop with a mic and camera for my zoom class and my desktop for homework at the same time and not needing two mice. The built in and customizable buttons and side scroller are in very accessible positions and makes gaming better.,29-Sep-20
1516,Drake,5,I had the mx first generation and the only reason I purchase this one is because someone took it. I would never use another mouse besides Logitech Mx line up. The ability to use this mouse on almost any surface is incredible. I have a laptop and many times I'm in places were the arm rest of a sofa is my mouse placement. The accuracy its amazing and for gaming it performs very good considering it's a mouse for everything. Highly recommend this product,29-Sep-20
1517,Johnny Wishbone,3,I'm using this with the MX Keys keyboard and the mouse does fit comfortably in my hand but the only negative or con that I noticed right away is the top or page scroll wheel. The wheel is a little too far away and my index finger and I can barely reach the wheel which causes me to have to shift my palm up slightly in order to scroll. I suppose I'll get used to this eventually but it is a disappointment. Everything seems to be solid and the mouse integrates well with Windows 10 and Bluetooth.,28-Sep-20

I love logitech products they last forever and work great (use for pretty much everything). This mouse is a little smaller than the old ones, and the wheels both feel better. I like the ability to scroll left and right and that new wheel is so much more useful than the old one becuase it is easier to reach and smoother.  i have this and their new ergo keyboard too, and the multi paring is really nice. They also support Bluetooth or a proprietary RF adapter which is replaceable. You can even find replaceable batteries and boots online for the mouse. just a great product.It a lot of money for a mouse, This one i intend to keep for years though.",27-Sep-20

1527,rg,5,This is a great mouse! For me it's the free spin wheel that makes all the difference. Combined with the ergonomic shape of the body it's ideal for long hours working on the computer.

<span> The mouse is very beautiful and ergonomic, but the scroll is not consistent, also the pointer jumps when you have it connected to the bluetooth of the Macbook Pro 2015. This expensive mouse is not worth buying as it comes with something so basic flawed.

1531,Anthony Cassetta,5,"I had to exchange this for the Logi MX Master 3 for MAC.  That said, I have been extremely impressed with the mouse and how much time it saves.  This mouse is near perfect and comfortable with extended use.  I think it is a great value at $99.00.",18-Sep-20
1532,TimothyNC,5,"This is hands-down the best mouse I've used... no... the best pointing device.  I've used all sorts of mice and trackpads including Apple but this is the most productive.  I had the MX 2S for over a year which was a good mouse although mine suffered from the ""stuck gesttures button"" syndrome and I had to open it up a few times to try to correct it. Also, the 2S wheel in ratched mode annoyed me with the sound but free spin was a little to free and I would scroll accidentally.  The MX 3, however, seems to fix both those issues with a better gesture button and the magnetic wheel.  I'm a software developer and I always have a crazy number of windows open and need to scroll through code and insanely long debug logs--this mouse is the cat's ""meow."" I would give it 6 stars if I could.",17-Sep-20

1534,EBE,5,"The MX Master 2 was a game-changer for someone who spends a LOT of time in spreadsheets, CAD, and coding. Ratchet -&gt; freewheel = awesome! Due to experiencing the known issue of the gesture button getting stuck, I ordered a MX3. Somehow it's better in almost every way.Pro: The wheel is heavier and more responsive. The thumb wheel likewise. USB-C is great (for me). The battery apparently draws energy from an alternate dimension. The app-specific button assignments are great (but not the defaults; you'll want to change those).Con: The back/forward buttons seem ill-placed (relative to MX2), but I have large hands, so maybe they're great for normal folks. Similarly, I wish it were bigger overall, with more force needed to click the main buttons. Sometimes the connection gets laggy, even with all the networking tweaks (ask Google) that make it tolerable. The Options software still wants to update too often, though has gotten better.Haven't tried Flow on it, but assume it's as good as the MX2. If you're deciding whether you need a fancy-pants mouse, you definitely do, and it's the best $100 you'll spend on an accessory.Bonus Pro: Easy fix for the MX2 (ask YouTube) put a great - if a little worn - mouse in my mobile office.",16-Sep-20
1535,Betty Li,3,"I have been loving this device, however recently the bottom of the mouse has worn the glue and caused the plastic contacting the mouse mat to start coming off, this has been a problem since it has started to wear at my mat and cause a scratching sound every time I use it.",16-Sep-20
1536,David,5,It’s a great mouse. Replaced original MX mouse that used charging dock. This is far above.  I could not get the software to install to customize buttons but wasn’t necessary to use. I work from home and use this for 8 hrs a day.  Scrolls smoothly and comfortable,14-Sep-20

The scrolling wheels are ridiculously smooth and the side scroll works flawlessly with apps such as Word or FCPX. Not too much resistance, just enough to not accidentally bump it. Feels like absolute luxury.Gaming? I think you can spend this money elsewhere on a product designed for wireless gaming. Workflow, school, etc,.. This is perfect.",10-Sep-20

This is a replacement for a 10 year old Performance MX.  The roller ball is amazingly smooth and fun to use.  I access many large files and very nice to be able to hit the roller ball and see it fly through the pages as opposed to clicking through pages.  The sensing is very accurate for use in Revit and AutoCAD and does not require the use of a mouse pad.

1544,Jack G,5,"I've owned all the mice in the MX Master line and this one is a solid contender for #1. Compared to the 2S, this mouse feels much better in the hand and the buttons feel much more solid. It has the sounds and feels of the door of an expensive luxury car, especially the scroll wheel which feels heavy and deep compared to the lighter and cheaper feel of the 2S wheel. However, the whole mouse is much lighter than the others in the line.It's way heavier and less precise than I would recommend for a gaming application, but it's easily the best mouse for productivity on the market today.",8-Sep-20

If you're picking up an MX master it should be for the features.The main scroll wheel is great (but you have to tune the sensitivity just right for your hand)The side scroll wheel is great in excel (although I wish you could freely spin it like the main scroll wheel)The gesture button is a powerhouse that I use far more than I would have assumed.Program-specific gestures and buttons has been such a huge improvement.The polling rate is quite noticeable if you try and do anything more than business oriented work, but having the dongle does improve latency slightlyThis works flawlessly with my MacBook and windows pc. I would recommend this version to anyone with a Mac since the Mac version doesn't come with the dongle!Finally.. the ergonomics. Frankly my least favorite part. I find the MxMaster 2 far more comfortable because you can use it like a normal mouse. I think the problem is the thumb rest being too low compared to the MX master 2 that snugly fit your thumb.  the hump of this mouse is snug but I find myself struggling in the learning curve to get accustomed to it. It took a little while and I can now use it for long periods of time.",7-Sep-20

1550,msun,2,"5-star mouse. 5-star scroll wheel. 0-star scroll wheel implementation. How Logitech could have gotten this so wrong is beyond me.If you loved the MX Master 2/S, then you'll love this mouse initially, but the scroll wheel will eventually drive you bonkers.The scroll wheel itself feels great -- even better than the 2S. It feels less plastic, less cheap and more high-end. It's also much less noisy. However the implementation of the scroll wheel -- well, let's say I won't be surprised if many customers return their mouse for a refund.As I research for solutions, I found there were originally a number of problems with the scrolling/scroll-wheel, some of which were fixed with software/firmware updates. However the primary issue still exists.This is the primary issue: the scrolling is inconsistent. There will be times where scrolling feels good, and times where the scroll barely happens at all. Of course it all depends on how you use the mouse, but in general when I'm browsing the web, I have to slow down and deliberately scroll the wheel in order to get anywhere.From what I can gather, this isn't fixable in software/firmware. It seems to be a hardware sensor issue.I requested a replacement thinking maybe this was simply a manufacturing defect. The replacement also had the same issue. Back to the 2S for me.",6-Sep-20
1551,Mc,3,"If you have shoulder pains or mouse shoulder, this mouse will only make it worse. The shape will help if you are having forearm and wrist pains though. The back and forward buttons are too stiff and still too small. It really takes a conscious effort to use. I have the MX Master 1 and the back/forward button on that is much harder to locate but way easier to push. Once you have muscle memory down, you can easily push the back and kind of push the forward buttons (forward button is too small so you still kind of have to feel for it). The gesture button on this version is also way too stiff. Having to push down on the gesture button and moving the mouse is just not a good experience.Pros:1. Great scroll wheel. The best I have ever used. Such a waste on this. I didn't have any issues like other users.2. USB-C connection. Good to have less cables around.3. Great battery life. At least from reported and my experience with the MX Master version 1.4. Horizontal scroll wheel. This is useful but I am starting to prefer the left and right tilts on the scroll wheel itself.5. Ergo is good for people with wrist or forearm pain.Cons:1. IMO this is bad for anyone with mouse shoulder or any kind of shoulder pain. After 15 mins of use on this and I had to tap out. The shape actually forces you to rotate your shoulder outward slightly. This is the motion you're trying to avoid if you have mouse shoulder.2. It is heavy for a mouse. Slightly better than the previous versions but still noticeable.3. Stiff back and forward buttons. Maybe it will soften up over time but I can see these buttons causing hand pain if you use them a lot.4. Gesture button too stiff. Using gesture button with movement is just not a fun experience.5. Horizontal scroll position seems off. Feels like it should be lower but that's where the back and forward buttons are. Maybe that was why the version 1 was designed with that layout.",5-Sep-20

I really love Logitech and want them to succeed but these new products suck.",5-Sep-20
1553,JK,1,"Summary: Mouse is twitchy, mis-clicks and has the worst software I've usedIt regularly causes me to click-drag-copy files in Windows and lowering it's sensitivity means I have to swipe too much, to get the mouse across my two screens.  No, I'm not new to using mice and I own a 10k dpi gaming mouse that I have no problems with.  And before you suggest I adjust the dpi, I should point out that ""Options"", the Logitech software for Windows (which has almost no options, ironically) doesn't allow the user to change the dpi or mouse polling rate.  There's only a sensitivity setting, like Windows 10 already has.But that's just a minor complaint.  The main problems are the mouse-wheel, which is touted as an improvement over normal wheels, but feels more like a really bad automatic transmission; always scrolling WAY to far, or not far enough.  And since they replaced the normal mechanism, you can't turn it off, but without the feature enabled, the wheel response is terribly sluggish.The biggest trigger for me, however, has to be the button design for the two main buttons.  The design flows over the front of the mouse, so that merely bumping into your coffee cup, or your keyboard will cause it to click the mouse!  We all have times in our computer use, where doing this would be disastrous.  If you have Windows 10 set to place your cursor above the ""OK"" button, whenever dialog windows come up, it's even more dangerous.I've been using a mouse with my computers since I was 8 years old; so 35 years.  Never have I had so many issues.  I never had a problem with a mouse being too sensitive or twitchy.  My G502 works great, but I need a wireless mouse.And if you're thinking of buying this mouse for the ability to use it on multiple desktops, I hope you don't use Linux, or you're in for a let-down.  I was hoping to use it with my Windows machine and one running Linux Mint Cinnamon 20, but Logitech doesn't develop for the Linux platform.I doubt anyone is going to see this review, without a lot of digging, but for those who do find it, check all the 5-star reviews, and 9 times, out of 10, you'll find that they are all affiliates for the product.  These people are literally just salesmen.  Don't trust a thing they say.  They get 10% or more from every sale.  Amazon allows this.  They might as well just let the companies make up completely fictional people and have sales people write the reviews.",4-Sep-20
1554,Orion Mfg,3,"Love this mouse's performance, was a user of the previous generation as well.  This is the most comfortable, customizable mouse ive ever used.  Build quality seems excellent.  Makes me feel baffled that i have to plug this in to charge, i have seen users comment on the usb-c to a cord and it totally is a bit silly, although im sure you could just use a usb c to c and it would still charge.  What i can't stand is that you even have to plug it in at all, these should wirelessly charge WITH the option to charge using a cord if need be, WITH an easily replaceable rechargable battery.  With the amount of tech this thing utilizes, it all goes out the window when it drops charge and i have to fish out an annoying cable.  Sure there is a pop up that shows you when its getting low in charge, but that makes it worse, nobody should have to look at a notification relating to their computer mouse, its tedious as hell.

I still think the price is too high, but for the obvious effort they put into this to make a better mouse I feel the end sum is that it's worth the price.

This tells me the software was never tested for users that require accessibility software.Update: October 1st 2020After working with Logitech support, and waiting for almost a month for a reply they came back and offered a replacement again despite this being a software issue. It is clear Logitech does not take this accessibility issue seriously. I will be going back to my other mouse.",1-Sep-20

1565,Jeff,5,"Amazing mouse! I had an older Logitech (10+ years) and it was starting to not register clicks so I splurged in the upgrade. SO glad I did! I have a large hand and this mouse fits perfectly. The thumb scroll is perfect for worksheet work, while the back/forward buttons and push able window select make this the perfect office mouse. I have yet to use it for gaming, but it should handle just as well (minus buttons if you’re into MMO’s). I decided on this one as opposed to rechargeable mice due to the battery life and charging speed. Considering the price point and inconvenience of the other, I am extremely happy with that decision.",30-Aug-20
1566,Fred M.,3,"Overall, the mouse seems to work great. The one thing I do not like is the weight. It feels too light and cheap.

I always balked at the idea of paying more than 30 dollars for a mouse, I mean what could an expensive mouse provide that could make it worthwhile to shell out more money?The answer is: zero distractions. Distractions equal wasted time to me and they add up. There's enough distractions at work everyday, don't let the things you can control be one of those distractions. Your hardware should not be one of those distractions. This mouse is creme de la creme and worth every cent.",30-Aug-20

After two different Corsair gaming mice died on me after a couple years use I decided to try another brand and purchased this one based on Amazon reviews. I'm glad I bought it... I love the performance, the software is easy to setup and use, and the ability to connect with 3 devices is great. Recharging via USB-C is a nice upgrade over older form factors too. Yeah, it doesn't have programmable RGB lighting and the dark gray matte isn't appealing to the eye, but the dang thing works perfectly and that's what really matters.",30-Aug-20

Every extra button will fail you aside from the regular 1 and 2 click buttons. Buy a $10 mouse for that. The software with Apple OS will drive you F'ing insane. So don't waste your cash. No support.

1573,Desert88,1,"I really wanted to love this mouse. I loved everything about it, ergonomics, buttons, the feel of the wheels etc... however there is a huge dealbreaker: the scrolling is buggy as hell. I have now tried two different mx master 3's and both had issues with scrolling. For example when scrolling up it would ""skip"" scrolls every few turns of the wheel causing my scrolling to stop on my computer then start again, quite often after scrolling the wheel will bounce back a bit and cause me to reverse direction ever so slightly etc... I tried all different kinds of settings and made sure my firmware was updated but no dice the issues remained. After going through two of them with the same issue I can't recommend anyone buys this. What a shame... If you don't believe me just google ""mx master 3 scroll issues"".",27-Aug-20
1574,Valentin Konovalov,2,First you feel how heavy it is. It's like 3-4 times more heavy than any other mouse. Clicks are bit too loud and haptic feedback from wheel is too strong (or non-existing if you turn it off). I returned this mouse because under heavy laptop load it stutters and lags. Even the cheapo wireless mouse I have now works much better than this mouse.,27-Aug-20
1575,ICarryOn,2,"I purchased this mouse in hopes that I can skip using a dongle with my thin USB-C laptop by switching to bluetooth connection. It does not work! Slightly better ergonomics compared to my still-working Performance MX, but it does not worth the $100! I cannot believe that Logitech would sell something so obviously flawed. Good old Logitech is dead--just the Logi part remains, but the tech is gone!",26-Aug-20
1576,drmrgd,2,"I really, really wanted to like this mouse.  It fits my hand like a glove, and I love the extra buttons, having just come from a very basic USB mouse.  It had such a nice hand feel, and although the thumb button is pretty useless as it's very difficult to press without pushing the mouse all over the place, I can live without it, especially since I can't map that button as I'll describe below. Also, the battery life is quite good.  I think I can generally get about 2 weeks or more on a full charge, using the mouse for probably 12 hours per day. The scroll wheels are fairly good, with a decent response, though I do see some odd jitter and lag from time to time, and the position of the thumb scroll wheel can be a bit awkward.But, that is, unfortunately where my joy for this mouse ends.  First, it's not a Linux mouse, despite the claim.  Yes, after plugging it into a Linux system, the pointer moves around and the buttons work (this is not unique as the protocols for basic mouse functionality work in pretty much any modern Linux kernel, and you should be able to pretty much plug any mouse you find in and have it work at this level).  But, the software designed to accompany the mouse and allow to to adjust the functionality, button mapping to applications, monitor the battery, etc. can not be installed on Linux, and you have to try to find some other 3rd party hacks as a surrogate. So, for example, I can not map the thumb button to anything, and am stuck with it in the default action, which is to swap between open applications like an Alt + Tab keyboard shortcut.  But, if you don't care about knowing the battery level and mapping the buttons to your liking, I guess that's not a big deal?Worse, the connectivity, whether it be though the WiFi or Bluetooth connection is awful.  I am constantly having dropouts, lag, and inconsistent responsiveness that is beyond frustrating.  This mouse is not at all, in any way, shape, or form usable for gaming.  And, even for just general office work, it can be maddening to have it jumping around while you're trying to cut and paste data in a spreadsheet, or click on the correct link in a webpage.  About 75% of the time it may work fine - even, arguably great.  But, then, for some unknown reason, it will just start flaking out and be useless for the next few hours.  I still have my 10 year old basic USB mouse connected just so that I can swap over to that when the mouse feels like flaking out.This mouse is expensive, and as such, I would have expected a much, much better user experience and performance.  It seems as though, many other users are seeing the same thing based on the reviews.  So, hopefully Logitech will figure out what's going on and either release a patch to correct the bad behavior (along with a supported Linux application!), or send out a better unifying receiver or something to address the spotty connectivity.In short, save your money and look for a more reliable and better built mouse, as this one is not nearly worth the cost.  And, if you are running Linux and want a full native experience, don't believe the claim on the box that it's a Linux mouse - it's not.",26-Aug-20

It's not only incredibly comfortable, it's also very functional and has fantastic software. I own mice by both Steelseries and Razer... and while they certainly have an emphasis on gaming, they do not lack features. Neither are half as ergonomic as the MX Master 3 and neither have software that is even close to as customizable. Before using the MX Master 3, I had not given Logitech much of my focus. But I will never use another mouse... if this wears out, I will simply buy another.",25-Aug-20
1580,Photoleif,4,"Update below. Bluetooth is finally working (fix included), and no skips and jittery behavior.---Original review---I had been having troubles with another Logitech MX mouse skipping and misbehaving. I chalked it up to that one being about ten years old, so I got this MX Master 3 since I really do like the feel and general usability of Logitech mice. Unfortunately this one also exhibited the exact same motion issue: stuttering, skipping, incredibly frustrating pauses. I had a look into the Logi forum and it appears to be interference with other wifi devices. I attempted to place the receiver very close to the mouse (it's on a USB extension cable now) and that failed to completely address the issue, though it seems to help a bit.I then tried the bluetooth interface, since that uses an entirely different frequency, protocol, everything...and that had even worse performance than the wifi interface. That could be my particular mouse, or my BT receiver, who knows. I'm simply resigned to poor performance from an otherwise mostly nice mouse. The roller initially performed exactly as described: hyper-fast, like mindblowingly extreme-fast. That has slowed now to scrolling at sub-par, very likely due to dust and cat fur. That brings me to another issue, namely the challenge in servicing this hardware. The maintenance-free, quite nice slick pads on the bottom are there in part to obscure screws, and getting the pads back on and still having them smooth and not catch on the mousepad, is a challenge, just as with older Logitech mice. At some point it's a losing battle, and I believe one must buy a set of new pads.I really want to like this mouse. I like the conveniently located fwd/back thumb buttons. I *liked* the hyperscroll, until it slowed to a crawl -- not its fault per se, but it should have been designed to have a closed hub to inhibit clogs. I like the feel of the button-presses, and I really like that the hyperscroll is button-selectable between clicking and free spin. But again, the free spin is not stellar if the wheel's hub becomes clogged. If you have a really clean house, no pets, no dust, hardwired ethernet, this is a superb mouse. Maybe your BT will work better than mine did, and you won't have stuttering. If you have fur, dust and so on, prepare to service this mouse with some frequency.---additional content---Bluetooth jitter and issues has been cleared up in Arch Linux via installing a blueZ compatibility layer. It also turns out that the unifying receiver cannot be plugged in and have bluetooth connectivity work. This is not documented well, or at all, in the documentation or on the Logitech website. I had to unplug the unifying receiver, switch the mouse button (underside) first toward the center of the mouse, then back up, then hold the 1-2-3 button to make visible. There's no documentation that states that this button acts as a bluetooth pairing button; it's always called a 'channel' button and that's in the context of the unifying receiver.Bad documentation both online and with the device. But I'm upping to a 4-star since it's finally working. The wheel issue is a drag on a 5-star.",25-Aug-20

1587,Dave,2,"4-month review: boo! I can't stand it anymore.There is no way to turn off the free-wheeling clutch mechanism, which turns on and off by itself and keeps the scroll wheel rolling long past when it should. Buy the MX 3 if you want your web pages to suddenly zoom into 800% magnification, apps to mysteriously cycle through all its tabs over and over, and for your finger to go noticeably numb from being used as a brake against the ridges in the scroll wheel.Speaking of pain, expect about 30 unintended clicks an hour do to the uncomfortably light touch on the buttons which cause you to have to ""hover"" above the buttons rather than rest on them, which will lead to muscle fatigue and pain in your flexi carpi radialis (specifically). It's a wholly inferior mouse to the much cheaper Logitech M720, and it doesn't match the quality and design of Logitech's keyboard in the same product line, the MX Keys. Don't be fooled by the gee-whiz gimmicks of this mouse. This is not the mouse you are looking for. Move along.",22-Aug-20

My hand feels like that part of the palm is working just to smallest bit harder. The thumb gesture button is just off being in a natural position for my thumb.  I wish it came with a profile for revit.  Literally the only downside is that the mouse click is a little louder and a little more higher pitch than the original MX.  But that's full on nitpicking.

What I mean is that it doesn't stop scrolling, it continues on its own, until you stop it with your finger.

Everything seems great on it and the scroll wheel was awesome! Unfortunately I like to be able to control my mouse with my fingertips for high accuracy tasks and the ergonomics made that really hard with the fact that the click buttons were not attached to the complete plastic housing (i tend to click far back.) Works ok with my upright work, but not my reclined which is more than 3/4 of my time. great mouse, just not for me. Also Please make the forward back buttons larger! My G700 will still keep on kicking with its horrible battery life.",18-Jul-20

1630,A,5,"I have a MX Master 2S which I use at my office.  When COVID hit, I strated working from home with an old mouse I had at home. It did the job fine but it recently broke, so I decided to upgrade to an MX Master 3 for my home office.This mouse is better than the 2S in many ways.1. The mouse's scroll wheel works better than it did on the 2s. The 2s had some issues in some situations, like with Google Maps, where it would either zoom in way too much at once, or not enough, the 3 seems to have fixed that.2. The continuous scroll on the mouse is MUCH quieter than on the 2s.  The 2s has a loud ""click"" when it starts and stops when used in the ""bumpy"" mode and not the smooth scrolling mode.3. The back and forward buttons are much better placed.  On the 2s they were so far back they were unusable for me.  I would still prefer them a bit more forward on the 3, but I have big hands.4. USB-C charging means I don't need a micro USB wire on my desk. The same wire now charges my phone, keyboard, or mouse.This mouse does have some weight to it, so it might not be the best choice for FPS gamers or people who need something super fast and accurate.  I play games on my PC, but nothing that demands that kind of speed so it works fine for me.I considered the 2S the best mouse on the market when I got it, and the 3 has outdone it.  I think this is a no brainer for anyone willing to spend the money for a good mouse.",17-Jul-20

What I didn't take into consideration were the amazingly sweet buttons and the free spin top scroll wheel. This thing is a joy to use and feels very well made and thought out.

Though, Bluetooth connectivity is the most attractive feature of this device as it allows you to switch between devices easily. Logi Tech's customer service is horrible and provided no help.

1636,Brent Woo,5,"I am a huge Logitech fanboy, I've had a marathon mouse that's been going strong for like 7 years, I only buy their keyboards, and I had an earlier version of this MX that—to this day I cannot figure out how but—I ""lost"" it, even though I never intentionally moved it from my desk. It just evaporated somewhere in my house.<br>Anyways, I got this MX 3 and love it, I have relatively big hands (span a 10th on piano) and always cramp up using smaller mouses. This one is fine. Feels solid quality, which feels good. Lots of buttons and it looks nice.BUT. And I have no idea how else to explain this, BUT. I cannot stop knocking it off the desk. This has never happened with any other mouse, wired or otherwise, but it's happened THREE times now (I'm writing this out of sheer frustration right after the third time) where I will reach over from the keyboard to the mouse and my fingers will catch it and straight up launch it off the desk, so this hundred dollar mouse just crashes to the floor and gets all scratched up and probably damaged inside. I have the same general setup and mousepad arrangement that I've had for two decades of computing. I don't know if it's just that it's a minuscule amount taller than other mice that I'm used to and my fingers are catching just so—but I feel like I have pretty good kinesthetics (I can play all my instruments blindfolded, if that means anything) and I've had it for 3 months or so now, so I should've adjusted by now. I'm pretty sure I'm going to break it because this keeps happening, and I don't want to put up a janky guardrail on my desk like I'm bad at bowling.Anyways, that's 100% user fault, so no slamming the product here. But I'm pretty sure mine is haunted by a suicidal ghost.</br>",13-Jul-20
1637,Letwin,5,The scrolling wheel design is revolutionary! Can't go back to regular mouses.,11-Jul-20
1638,Ryan,3,"I bought this with the MX Keys. We have a Mac mini and a perfectly stable ASUS Prime Deluxe II PC build for composing music. The keyboard switches between both computers great, feels good and the modifier keys are cool. The mouse is not. Through Bluetooth, the mouse is not nearly as responsive as through the wireless receiver. Secondly on the PC, the software routinely geeks out and changes DPI/navigation resolution and hangs - with the receiver 18” away line of sight. I believe this is because unlike other wireless Logitech mouses I have, this one does not save the settings internally, and must work through the software for everything in real-time. This makes sense if you are switching computer platforms on the fly, but it often gives you very poor performance when you least expect it and is not dependable. My wife is content using it to surf the web on a Mac. Otherwise it’s a big waste of money on performance for people doing media-based film/music production. You’ll run into random lag and navigation problems while your only using 10% cpu. It requires a restart to reset the software and before you run into this without expecting it - it does NOT work wired. It only charges wired. SmhNeat idea, poorly executed.",10-Jul-20

1640,M. T,1,"I use this in an apt that I share with two other people.  Other times I go to work I would like to bring this to the office. For some reason many of the iterations of the MX series have improved some aspects but have ignored this one. I as well as many others would want a mouse that has a more muted click sound I know I'm clicking it when I press it, there's no need to have such a loud click sound when I'm clicking at night when roommates are sleeping or when I'm the rogue emloyee at my company who has the loudest mouse clicking away.  It really serves no purpose to have such a loud click mechanism.  To mute it and dampen the sound would be amazing because when you're clicking away in an apt, it really echos throughout.  If I have someone over and they are sleeping, I can't work in the same room because the clicking is so loud. No other mouse clicks as loud as this one. Why don't you take it down several notches and dampen the sound.",9-Jul-20
1641,shabanga,1,"Let me just say this, the mouse is extremely nice. It feels incredible in the hand and I don't know how else to say it than the mouse feels ""luxurious"".  It also works flawlessly on my glass desktop which I've never had a mouse do up to this point.  I opted for this over the Master 2S primarily because of the USB-C charging, but the magnetic adaptive scroll wheel is also very nice.So, why 1 star?  Pretty simple.  The only way to switch between multiple devices without using the Flow software is a button ON THE BOTTOM OF THE MOUSE.  Said button is also the only location for visual feedback of which device the mouse is connected to.  Somehow my $30 Triathlon is better than this $100 mouse in this regard which is ridiculous.  Even more ridiculous is the fact that moving this functionality to another button is currently IMPOSSIBLE in the software, despite every button seemingly being able to be any function on the computer or mouse, this is the one exception and it's incredibly frustrating.  I could excuse this on a less expensive mouse (like the Triathlon) but on what is more or less the pinnacle of Logitech's mouse line I expect better.  Had I known of this limitation I probably wouldn't have bought it and am debating sending it back.In addition to that major flaw, one reason I wanted this mouse was the horizontal scroll wheel.  It works as advertised, but I find the speed/acceleration much faster than expected, even at its lowest setting in the Options software.  Also, this wheel is smooth scroll only which I suppose is good for things like zooming, but it would have been nice for a ratcheted option for things like scrolling Excel cell by cell, or clicking through tabs in the browser.  This is a minor annoyance, but compounded with the major flaw and the fact that this mouse is hideously expensive, I have to give it a rare (for me) 1-star review.",9-Jul-20
1642,Brian S.,5,"I bought this to replace my G700, has been perfect for the office. Buttons are solid and feel like quality. The programming software makes it easy to set shortcuts like Copy and Paste, something I spend most of the day doing.",9-Jul-20

1644,Rich H.,4,"Good: Just about everything. The ergonomics are much better than I'd thought at first view. Hand/wrist position is perfect; I'm using a mouse pad with built-in wrist rest but I suspect the latter isn't necessary with this mouse. Tracking is smooth and precise on every surface I've tried it on, including my denim-clad leg. Button action is very light, but your hand position is such that you're unlikely to click accidentally. Selector button on the underside lets you switch between three different receivers, which works well once you figure out how to pair it with a new receiver (see below.) Haven't used it long enough to verify battery life, but four days of intensive use hasn't fazed it. USB-C charging might put some people off but it comes with its own cable, and USB-C enables rapid charging. After four days of several-hours-daily use, I can't think of anything bad to say about this mouse. Except...Bad: I bought this along with Logi's MX Keys keyboard, so I needed to pair both with both receivers. The getting-started sticker on the mouse's underside wasn't quite clear on the pairing process, so I looked it up on Logi's website. No problem: power up the mouse, press the ""connect"" button, plug in the receiver, and done. I flip the mouse over, switch it on, receiver select ""1"" starts flashing as it's supposed to, I press the...wait a minute, there's no ""connect"" button. Online manual clearly shows it between the power switch and the sensor. Nope. So about 20 minutes of research and fumbling later, I discover that it's necessary to download and install 200 meg of Logitech bloatware, click through multiple screens of features of the device I've already paired, and pleas to open an account (nope) and send my every click to Logi for analytics (double nope,) and then figure out how to get to the pairing screen. Once I found that, the pairing was almost effortless. My point, however, is that none of this should have been necessary. It's a MOUSE, people, it should be plug-and-play to at least get it working before considering enhancements. At the very least you shouldn't have to run an online gauntlet to be able to use what is now a fundamental peripheral. Would have sucked if I hadn't had internet access at the time. Also...Ugly: The required pairing software doesn't work on Linux, which means I had to install said bloatware on my work machine and pair up both receivers there. It wasn't a problem, but could easily have become one if the system admins took note.Bottom line: The MX Master 3 lives up to its reputation. This replaced an older Logi mouse, and I don't miss the old one a bit. Five stars, minus one because the apparently deliberate move to force users to install an app just to make the device usable - and a Windows-only app at that - annoyed me just enough to take back that fifth star.",7-Jul-20

I love the Mac trackpad so much I don't even mind designing in 3D CAD software with it, but this mouse has been a very pleasant surprise. The Mac's trackpad gestures are a big reason why I didn't want to leave the Apple ecosystem for a mouse, but this mouse has built in capabilities that allow you to mimic those gestures! Outside of that great feature the mouse is incredibly programable for a bunch of different applications such as the whole Adobe Creative Cloud suite and even 3D modeling software such as Rhino or Revit!",6-Jul-20
1649,Andrew,4,"This mouse has fantastic ergonomics and I love the weight.  I rally like the side scroll wheel and the forward/back buttons are placed pretty well.  I have noticed that the receiver needs to be fairly close or the response starts to lag.  This could potentially be an issue in competitive gaming, but not an issue for productivity really.  Not an issue at all if you are able to have the mouse about 2-feet or less from the receiver.I really like that this can be paired with more than one receiver and is the reason I purchased this mouse.  That feature works perfectly.  The flow technology works reasonably well.  There is slight lag when moving between computers, but I would not expect it to work the same as with two monitors on a single computer.",6-Jul-20
1650,Ashwin K,5,I have in the past used only apple magic track pads or mac itself. Felt that a traditional mouse would limit the gesture controls which are important for my workflow. Tried this mouse and have been impressed and I seem to have been discovering new ways to map gestures per app and for the whole OS and makes it so productive with minimal effort. Its a great purchase. The only con was I have never got the unifying receiver to work. It seems to be stuttering in the unifying mode while works smooth in bluetooth mode.

1654,Arthur Senior,5,"I've been using Logitech mice ever since the company started pretty much. After all those crappy non-gaming mice that Microsoft were putting out back in the 90's, somebody had to step up! But if your old school like me, then you remember Logitech's logo back in the day. Turns out the company rebranded themselves to ""Logi"", following fears, that their company was considered a dinosaur by young folk. The re-branding's intention, is to make themselves seem hip as ever.How many remember the Logitech MX1000 wireless laser gaming mouse? Over 15-years ago Logitech came out with that mouse, captured my heart forever. Used it for 7-years until the lithium battery died for good. Then I bought my first ""G"" mouse, the G700, back when the mice still were remanescent of the MX1000, just with added features and performance. Then the mice went total futuristic and overkill, when the G502 and G9 series came out lol.The Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced, is literally one of the best mice out there. It still amazes me to this day, just how many features that they can pack, into a small space. The weight feels about the same as the old MX1000 and G700, so if you've used those mice before, then you will be used to it. The Master series has actually been around for several years now, and this is the 3rd generation mouse.Because of the weight, this mouse does not glide over my cloth Hcman mouse pad, as easily as my Razer Deathadder Elite wired gaming mouse. However, the mouse pad was designed to allow a mouse tracking sensor, to have 100% precision in every micro-inch of movement. Wireless mice will glide easier over a plastic based mouse pad, however, the mouse will probably be less precise if you use one. So stick with a micro-fiber cloth mouse pad if you can.This is a 7-button mouse, and as expected, there are many functions. Left Click, Middle Click, Right Click, Vertical Scroll, Forward Click, Backward Click, Productivity Button, Horizontal Scroll. Scroll Mode button adjusts the scroll wheel mode, clicky or smooth. On the bottom of the mouse is the ON/OFF switch, as well as the Bluetooth mode selector, and of course, the DARK FIELD sensor, that can track on literally everything, including your ham sandwich.I bought this, so I would have a quality wireless mouse, for my tablet computer. Because it can be programmed for more then just 1-device at a time, I can also use this with my notebook computer. Its important to note however, Logitech software only works on Windows or MAC, there is no software support for Android. This mouse works perfectly with an Android tablet however, using Android standard drivers and functionality, built into the OS.As soon as I turned the mouse on, the #1 mode began flashing. I searched for Bluetooth devices on my tablet, and immediately the mouse was discovered, and paired quickly. Reception is excellent, the cursor moved almost as smoothly as my wired Razer Dethadder Elite gaming mouse. If your somebody who does photoshop, or Adobe Premiere for production and editing work, you will love this mouse, plenty of sensitivity to get the job done.Browsing the internet performance is very good as well. Other then the standard vertical scroll wheel that all modern mice have these days, I found myself also enjoying, the horizontal scroll wheel, which allowed me to scroll the pages left/right. This makes browsing the internet on a tablet much easier, and quicker. If you've been using your touch screen before, this mouse is going to be quite the upgrade for you!Gaming performance is very good for a mouse that isn't technically rated to be meant for gaming. Unless your a competitive gamer, trying to reach the top ranks in COD, Battlefied, Fortnite, PubG, you don't need no 144 hertz G9! These MX Master 3 mice have more precision then the MX1000 had, its plenty for gaming IMO, and I did not have any problems.I also do photoshop and video editing, but not professionally, and I find this mouse very easy to use. The ergonomics of this mouse are top notch, best I've seen! I find this mouse very comfortable to use. The mouse clicks are fairly strong, which provides tactile feedback. And the forward and back buttons, are thankfully not mushy like previous models, also very tactile. If you don't like loud mice, you might want to stay away, tactile feedback, means there is gonna be click noise.Logitech seems to only have this mouse in either Graphite, or Mid-Grey. It would be nice if they came out with an pure Black version, as well as a Blue, and premium Red version. But like I said, they are catering to production artists more with this mouse then gamers. Still, Logitech should offer more custom options, it would get them more sales IMO.If you don't want your mouse to look like a space ship however, and your not a super competitive gamer, you can avoid the G502 and the G9, and just go with the MX Master 3. In my opinion, its a fully featured mouse, with excellent precise control from the Dark Field sensor, excellent customisability of buttons through the driver software, and excellent ergonomics. Very well made mouse, and I am going to have to give it a solid 5 out of 5 stars!",3-Jul-20

1658,Vi3tDacBiet,2,"I do mainly computer work such as 3D design and animation so I need a reliable and accurate mouse. I got tired of using all these popular ""gaming"" mice because something keeps wearing out: a button, the wheel, the sensitivity, etc.I decided to get something more professional and higher quality. This seemed like a good candidate so I gave it a try. So far I love everything about the mouse except for the fact that it cannot be used wired. You MUST use the dongle that comes with it to transmit and receive signal. You can use it while it is plugged in but it only charges the mouse, not transmit data.The problem with this is the dongle isn't accurate and secure. It randomly skips or loses signal all too often. The dongle is on my desk and about 2-3 feet from the mouse with nothing in between. It's such a pain to do work and not have the mouse do what you want it to. I was hoping to be able to use the mouse directly plugged into the computer to fix this issue but I can't.I will try a few more weeks before I decide to go for a wired mouse.",27-Jun-20

I have customized the buttons in my personal computer, but they don't work in my office laptop and i cannot install the software in my office laptop.

1662,Ed Schultz,1,"After extensive research I purchased this mouse as it came with the claim that is was highly ergonomic. However, this is without a doubt the least ergonomic mouse I have ever tried. I don't know where to begin with all the things that are wrong with it.First, the forward and back buttons on the thumb are way too small. If you want to go forward, you have to contort your thumb in a very unpleasant fashion to click on it. For the back button, unless your knuckle is sitting right below the button, you will have the same issue.As for the mouse, I want it fit my hand like a glove. I should be able to comfortably rest my hand on it. This is not at all possible with this mouse. My entire hand is in a tented position with my index finger at an odd angle spinning the wheel. And I push the mouse with the other fingers instead of my palm.No matter how you look at it, every part of your hand and wrist is going to hurt.NOTE: I gave this 1 star for the product and NOT the seller.

I just like the shape of the device as a whole, find it comfortable to use, and the only functions I really care about (button 1, button 2, and center scroll wheel) all perform flawlessly. But after all is said and done, it's horribly expensive for a mouse not made entirely  out of platinum, and I would not buy it nor any mouse at the current list price (99 bux).

This mouse builds on the strengths of its predecessors to make a much more refined product.Caveats:1) The unifying receiver is still using USB-A as the input method. I wouldve preferred it to be USB-C so I dont have to use an adapter on devices that dont have USB-A anymore.2) The charging cable is also USB-C to USB-A ( this part going into your device which you use to charge the mouse) .

The mouse should conform to your hand not the other way around.Its obviously usable. But this is not something you wont to use day in and out for years.Bring back the MX Revolution.</br>",6-Jun-20
1677,Simon The Great,5,"I was looking for a Logitech mouse that was wireless, had decent battery life, and had all sorts of buttons and programmable options.  This fit the bill!  I use it daily at work, it fits my hand well, and does everything I ask it to do.  Great product!",5-Jun-20
1678,Cornelius Peynado,4,This is an incredible product. I do however see some evidence of use on the one I received from this seller,5-Jun-20
1679,Barb,5,I've had this mouse for 6 months now and I would highly recommend it! I bought mine from a computer store but I wanted to leave a review here because I love this product so much. I was previously using the apple magic mouse but was having wrist pain after spending hours at my computer for work. With the MX 3 I haven't had any wrist pain (though sometimes my fingers need a stretch from clenching it tightly for a long period).My two favorite features are the horizontal scroll wheel and the multi computer pairing (up to 3 computers). It is SO convenient to be able to switch from my laptop to my desktop with the touch of a button (on the bottom of the mouse). It's also a breeze bringing it into the office because of the bluetooth USB that's included. Plug in the USB to the computer and your mouse is good to go on another machine!The battery life is impressive. I've definitely gone at least two weeks without charging it. Unlike Apple's magic mouse -- the charging port is in the front of the mouse so you are able to continue to use the mouse while it's charging. It charges with a USB-C cable.Also the mouse has several different buttons that are customizable to different applications you use. It's a genius feature but I've been too lazy to set it up.I spent more than I thought I ever thought I would on a mouse but it's totally worth it -- especially if you work at a computer for 8+ hours/day.,3-Jun-20

1681,B. Schlueter,4,"The charging cord appears to be proprietary. Do not misplace it, leave it in a hotel, on an airplane, in couch cushions or let the dog eat it.

1683,B. P.,5,"while searching for a keyboard.  I bought the Logitech Ergo K860 keyboard and needed a mouse to go with it and bought the MX Master 3.  The keyboard is great...no complaints, but the mouse is awesome!  I had no idea I needed a mouse like this.  I often look at huge spreadsheets and diagrams and I have never had a mouse with horizontal scroll or a normal scroll that is as fast as this.  This is going to help my efficiency for sure and the comfort of the new keyboard and mouse will help me work longer without getting tired.  Great Combo!  Logitech Ergo K860 and MX Master 3 mouse!",31-May-20
1684,Michael,4,"I like Logitech mice which I use with my Mac through a Bluetooth connection.  My previous mouse was a Logitech MX Anywhere 2S.  While I was very happy with this mouse, its vertical scrolling, using its mouse wheel, left much to be desired, especially when I tries to use it with any of my web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome) or Microsoft Excel.  My new Logitech MX Master 3, although bulkier, offers me better functionality especially with vertical scrolling.  This purchase met my expectations.",29-May-20
1685,Styx,3,"The ergonomics of this mouse are terrible. The right edge is smooth and slope-y, and doesn't give you a good surface to grip. It, therefore, makes it difficult to move the mouse left/right without feeling like the mouse will just slip out of your hand (even though it won't). It's very distracting when using it.As for Logitech Flow, well, they have more than a few kinks to iron out in their software. ""Flow""ing from my Windows laptop to Mac is either slow (takes a minute for the destination laptop to pick up the mouse signal) or just doesn't happen (which is when I switch the mouse off and use the toggle switches on the bottom to connect to the desired laptop). Both scenarios are frustrating.After disabling Flow altogether, some issues persist. There are still times when the Mac won't pick up the mouse (this happens with the MxKeys keyboard as well) and I need to pair the mouse/keyboard again with the laptop. This should not be happening with $100 products.I'm happy to deal with this problem for the keyboard- the key quality is great, the backlight is very useful- but with the mouse, I would've just preferred to buy a regular old Bluetooth mouse and moved the dongle over to the laptop I used.In short, this mouse is not worth it.",29-May-20
1686,Kat J,5,"We needed an extra mouse for the office.  Was using a Logitech Performance to MX 3.  The Logitech Performance mouse was just fine.  A very good mouse.  However, I do have the following comments with this mouse.1.  More comfortable2.  Nicer texture3.  Scroll wheels are awesome.  Best I have ever used4.  Battery life.  Awesome.  No charging station so one less item on my desk.I am happy that I purchased this mouse.  Makes my life a little easier.",29-May-20
1687,La Malaise,3,"Look at the support community at Logitech for this mouse. You'll see a consistent problem with the scroll wheel and less often the mouse pointer itself just quitting working for a few seconds.I had the problems.  Support was only via email, so it took days to get the several round trips to try and resolve. They finally suggested updating the USB and Bluetooth drivers on the PC.  That fixed most, but not all, of the problems.  Logitech opted to send me a new mouse. Same problems with it.I am baffled that Logitech's mouse doesn't work with drivers on a laptop that is less than 2 years old.  What about backwards compatibility?Other than the above, the mouse (when working) is great!PROS: - Great feel in the hand. - Scroll function (that accelerates for faster scrolls as you spin the control) is super for scrolling through large datasets. - Ability to use the mouse in both Bluetooth and with the Logitech dongle is a great feature. - Ability to use the mouse with 3 separate systems is great! (Small button on the bottom to select.) - USB-C charging is nice, and the battery is decent.  (Not as good as the alkaline mice I've had in the past, but much better than the chargeable mouse I replaced - I am a heavy user and have to charge every 4-5 days. - New management software allows for much more customization (even by program), albeit it's not as intuitive as one would like.  Took some trial and error to change things.CONS: - See failure discussion above. - No user-accessible battery compartment. So when that rechargeable battery goes (typically by not holding a charge very long), I'll be forced to buy a new mouse or take my screwdriver to it. - Logitech support quality is low. Ability to identify a solution to a common problem (just look at the support community) isn't there, and the email process is way too slow.In short, I recommend this mouse IF you are willing to immediately return it if it doesn't work. Don't bother with Logitech support.",29-May-20

Tried all their solutions, uninstalling, deleting files, reinstalling. nothing.I'm not the only one with this problem. Even worse, installing the Options software also took over all my keyboard options and now I can't set any keys on that either. I don't recommend getting anything from Logitech that installs their new Options software. Too bad. A lot of money for something that doesn't work.

1692,James K.,2,"This would be a 5 star review as I love the mouse.  I have an issue though where when I place my finger on the scroll wheel it clicks.  Whenever I actually press the scroll wheel for middle click it clicks twice.  This does not affect performance of the mouse itself but I paid a premium for it because I wanted better quality and it should not be happening.  Logitech support will not help me and after sending them a video with the click being clearly audible they told me they don't see a problem, and I cannot crack it open to see whats going on inside as that will void the warranty.  Hopefully if you purchase this thing you will have better luck than I did but if you have to deal with Logitech support, well I wish you the best.",25-May-20

1699,Guillermo,4,"This mouse is amazing. I use it with several screens, which were super easy to set up with the guide they provide online. Fully customizable buttons, though they take some getting used to with how I have to move my thumb: mostly because I haven't used my thumb for things like this before.It's only 4 stars because while it works perfect it was advertised as new, but when I inspected it the bottom gliding pads were clearly scuffed and used, even a small scratch near one of the logos underneath, and yes that was before I used it.",16-May-20
1700,Phil,2,"Bottom line up, I ended up initiating return after about 2 hours of use/trial.CONS:1. Scroll Wheel: The biggest issue with this mouse is the scrolling, scrolling is VERY inconsistent.  When you are scrolling up and down with the scroll wheel, it does not move at a smooth or constant rate. If you are used to trackpad or magic mouse, you probably know what I mean.2. Gesture button: The location of this gesture button is not optimal.  I attached the pictures but naturally, your finger will rest much higher than where the gesture button is actually located and it's really hard to use the whole gestures.  My main productivity involves around all these gestures.  I'm currently running a dual monitor setup with multiple desktop spaces per screen, and having easy access to mission control and full desktop scrolling is crucial for me.  This unnatural placement of the gesture button makes these functions really hard.3.  ** EDIT: LOGITECH commented saying there is a way to setup with a single dongle. Please discard this** USB dongle:  This one is not a deal-breaker BUT... it's still a CON for me.  So, I purchased this mouse as a set with the MX Keys.  I initially thought since these two devices are in the same product line, I could just get away with using a single USB dongle.  But until I had both of the dongles plugged in, I was not able to use both devices.  So, having to use two dongles pretty much fills up all my port and I need to get an additional hub in order to compensate for lack of USB space.  If I were to use a magic mouse, magic trackpad, and full size magic keyboard, I wouldn't even need a single port because they all run on bluetooth.  Sacrificing one USB port is ok, two is just not optimal.After realizing all these flaws within an hour or so of use, I just had to initiate return because using the MX Keys and MX Master 3 will not increase any of my productivity.PROS:Since I did a fair amount of complaining, here are some plus.1. Software:  Logitech software is pretty amazing when it comes to customization.  You are able to inverse the trackwheel scrolling directions on mac without affecting the natural track scrolling directions of the trackpad or the OS settings itself.  This is actually a huge plus since there are other manufacture mice (razer) that do not let you do this and when you inverse the mouse directions on the macOS settings itself, you are inversing trackpad scrolling as well.  Logitech has an override for the trackwheel scrolling direction, and it's really awesome.  Also, you can map A LOT of different gestures/functions to additional buttons on the mouse, and have options to map buttons differently according to the app you are using.2. Mouse Track:  Tracking on the mouse is really awesome, no signs of an intermittent drop in connections, and feels almost like using a wired mouse.",15-May-20
1701,M. Nichols,5,"I've been using Logitech mice for decades, but I've also used each MX Master mouse (versions one and two).  I purchased the MX Master 3 a few weeks ago and it's far and away the best mouse I've ever used.  Feels great, works great... It's just perfect for my use case.It charges over USB-C, and comes with a USB-C to USB-A cable to charge, but the Logitech Unifying Receiver is still USB-A, so if you're a MacBook user, take note.  But since it also has built-in Bluetooth, you can connect to any Bluetooth-enabled computer, so there's really no worry.  Also works great with the new iPadOS that supports mouse input.",15-May-20
1702,V. Truong,3,"I have been using the G502 wired version for a couple years. Earlier today I picked up the new Logitech Keys and since Logitech Flow is definitely a great feature to have, I picked up the new MX Master 3 mouse as well. I'm not sure why people have been raving the scrolling wheel on this mouse?!?! The technology has been used on pretty much all Logitech G mouses for quite sometime now. Not only that, if you have been using something like the G502 (mine is 4-5 yrs old and wired which is being sold for less than $50), this mouse is nowhere close. The scrolling wheel is heavy, the sensor is just not as precise as the G502. Anyhow, very premium packaging. Finish is alright. Overall, it still is a great upgrade for anyone coming from standard mouse that came with your desktop. If you have been using G series mouse from Logitech and temping to get it with your MX Keys, I would just skip it for now and save the money. As of right now, I'm heavily consider the wireless G502 but that also means I'm loosing Logitech Flow feature.",15-May-20
1703,Aaron,2,"Update: I'm having a major issue with this mouse where every few minutes or so the polling rate drops drastically and it becomes very unresponsive for 5-10 seconds. It sounds minor, but makes it really tedious to use as I'm constantly having to stop what I'm doing.Pros:Overall the MX3 feels great in your hand (no double entendre's here) and is generally wonderful to use. It has a nice weight that makes if feel very sturdy without hindering movement. The battery life is also quite nice, though we'll see how that ages. The gesture button is also a bit strange, but an interesting idea. I'm just not sure how much mileage I'll end up getting out of it.Cons:I'm really not a fan of the scroll wheel. It's very quiet which is nice, but actually using it to scroll is more painful than even the cheapest mice I've used. Even in locked mode it will start free-wheeling if you scroll fast enough, which is strange considering it also has an unlocked mode that functions the same. It also starts to feel really weird to use in the middle ranges and it leads to this weird feeling where you can't really accurately predict how far you're going to scroll down.  I also find myself really missing the ability to switch DPI profiles easily (like with the G903) when I hop into a game.",14-May-20

1706,E. Biser,3,"I am using this mouse in combination with MX3 keyboard via a single dongle.  It works, most of the time.  I experience ""lag jumps"" constantly on the mouse (not the keyboard).  Logi forums are full of reports of the same issue without a resolution so I am not sure how people are ok with this and give it such a high rating.  Forget about using it while gaming.  The design of the device is not that ideal either.  The mouse fits well into my hand; however, I wish it was heavier for a more solid tracking feel.I will most likely return this product, as $100 dollar price is not worth the mediocre tracking issues.  I can try again when it is ready for primetime.",14-May-20
1707,Clarijoh,1,"It is amazing that this new release of the MX Master does not work reliably with Mac.Each time it restarts the Mac does not connect automatically to it, and although the Mouse shows up in bluetooth preferences it still will not manually connect. The mouse needs to be removed from bluetooth and then manually reconnected.I have followed all Logitech's advice and restarted bluetooth and removed the plist file!I would have thought that Logitech could do a better job of something as basic as bluetooth connectivity. In fact the original MX Master which I still have is more reliable in connecting to bluetooth, whereas this one must have the prior connection deleted AND a new connection made before it works. The fact that Logitech has a special section on their website to report bluetooth connectivity problems perhaps tells you all that is needed about their confidence in their product. In 2020 bluetooth connectivity should not be difficult for anyone!!!Don't buy if you have a Mac and want reliable connectivity.",13-May-20
1708,tdiggity,3,"* The mouse stutters like hell over plain Bluetooth connection* Logitech Options is the only way to truely ""Pair"" the device after the initial Bluetooth connection (and requires a second pointing device in the meantime)* To fix stutter issues, disconnect the mouse from Bluetooth and connect another mouse, then plug in the dongle (called ""Unifying receiver""), open Logitech Options and say ""Connect Device through Unifying Reciever"", then turn the device off then on again. You can now put away the other mouse and use this oneIf you bought this device because you wanted to free up a USB slot then I feel sorry for you. Simply put the mouse is nothing without the dongle, so you need the USB dongle plugged in. Otherwise the mouse will stutter so bad you will wish for something different. So yes, you can use one dongle to connect the keyboard and the mouse but you at least need the dongle. You cannot hardly use this over simple bluetooth.It is a good product with a nice design and feels good in the hands, but the connection issues are a little worrying for something that costs as much as this does. It's strictest competition is cheap, reliable USB dongle Keyboard and mouse combos that are plug and play so to have this not work over bluetooth and not work out of the box with the dongle surely means that this product will suffer in the general consumer market unless something is done to alleviate the connectivity issues.The stuttering is unbearable over bluetooth. Skip it and use the dongle. I was hoping to have 2 less things plugged into USB (mouse and keyboard) but now I just have one less USB connection (keyboard and mouse share) which really isn't that great of an improvement to be completely honest.Really anything in the with plug and play functionality is probably worth it. I like the ergo feel of this mouse and it has some cool features like the thumb wheel and gestures but it comes at the cost of being able to be set up out of the gate and for some reason requires a completely separate set of software acting as a middleman that completely blows my mind.For something in this price range you would really want it to be like 4.5 5 stars. Mouse and pointing technology has not matured past 20 years ago when I was using computers as a child. Turns out not much has changed it seems. So maybe turn your attention to something that will save you some money in the long run unless you will be using the daylights out of the sides croll and hotkeys feature.",11-May-20
1709,Mo' Data,1,"I came to this from the original MX Mouse - which was still going strong, but my son dropped it and the back/forward buttons got jammed. I've had the original one since 2013 and it just refused to die of natural causes. :-)So when it broke I was actually excited to 'upgrade'.Bad move!Two reasons:a) Getting worse carpal tunnel symptoms with this mouse - the ergonomics are just not the same as the original mouseb) The metal in the mouse makes a super annoying sound whenever I click.I'll be using a Microsoft Keyboard/Mouse combo instead - with their ergonomic mouse. I use that at work already - but like to keep things different to avoid repetitive injury issues.

I ""upgraded"" to a $20 mouse and that was a noticeable difference but the busier I got with work, the more I realized I needed something better.After 3 months of reading reviews, I decided to bite the bullet with the MX Master 3. I only wish I would have made the jump sooner. I have to scroll through large documentations all day long and the scroll wheel alone is worth the cost of upgrading. Everything feels smoother on my PC with the new mouse. Clicks are a breeze and the mouse feels great in my hands. I'm still learning some of the customized features and gestures. The back and forward buttons  easy to reach and use.If you work from home, need a mouse for office productivity and can afford it, go with this mouse.",7-May-20
1712,Daniel,1,"For $100 you expect pretty good things in a mouse... this doesn't quite make it and doesn't function as advertised!This is pushed as working with the MX Keys and similar logitech keyboards to function across multiple devices.  These features simply do not work without installing (frankly awful) ""Options"" software on all devices (which isn't possible if you're trying to use this on remotely managed work devices).The mouse in particular has it's ""device selection"" or easy-switch located UNDER the mouse.  So, switching between devices requires two hands as you need to pick up the mouse, flip it upside-down, then pushing a recessed button (perhaps multiple times) to toggle between devices.  The mouse doesn't not work/coordinate with the keyboard, so you then need to select the desired device separately using the easy-switch on the keyboards.In other words, the claims of usability across multiple devices are exaggerated/not quite there.However, the issues don't end there ... the ergonomics aren't quite right.  This mouse feels small, light, and awkward next to the older Perfomance MX mouse (which I think was one of the better mice Logitech made).  The only improvement I think may be the slightly wider main scroll wheel on the MX Master 3.In general I'm massively disappointed with the MX Master 3 ... it feels sub-par and doesn't meet my functional expectations.

Paired with the keyboard from the same brand, this ecosystem opens up a very complete experience of improved typing and mouse interaction. I may not suggest this mouse for serious gaming as I'm worried that this may ruin the buttons which to me feel like too precious and not too robust for a gaming intensity.One feature I wish to see is the desktop selection button to be on the accessible surface of the device. The button is right now, underneath the mouse which requires me to constantly lift the mouse.

1726,Chile,1,"First, the product is nice. The buttons, feel, packaging, everything else about the mouse is very good. However, if you plan to use this as a Bluetooth mouse, in one word, don't.I have had this now for a handful of weeks. Foolishly, I discarded the packaging (and the USB dongle) or I would return this. The BT mouse continues to stop working when the screen saver comes on (password screen required for work laptop). I've invested quite a lot of time searching the web (and the Logitech website). There is abundant information on updating drivers (and uninstalling/re-installing Bluetooth drivers), insuring that services for BT is set to ""automatic,"" and using device manager to insure that the BT interface isn't permitted to power off to save power (you'll see it in device manager Bluetooth). In addition, I noted that there is a new entry Bluetooth Low Energy GATT in ""Human Interface Devices""  with a similar setting. The web suggested a change to the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion) changing it from 6.3 to 6.2. After all the above (and contacting Logitech), nothing seems to work. So, I have a $100 paperweight as unpairing and re-pairing each time I walk away from the computer us absurd.Again, if you desire to use this as a BT mouse (as I did in my case having a laptop with very few USB connections and did not want to carry a USB hub) don't buy this product.It may not be fair to give this one star as this may have more to do with Windows 10 than the mouse itself. But, it just seems that something this flaky should not be offered as a potential use model. The really peculiar thing is that I was using another BT mouse (Logitech) that after some years began to fail that never exhibited these symptoms.",27-Apr-20

1729,Meng,3,"It looks like I'm not the only one with an inconsistent scroll wheel. Both the thumb and scroll wheel are terrible. First, the scroll wheel skips and stutters. The thumb wheel inconsistent too. I have to really scroll the thumb wheel to get it to register so that it'll switch tabs on Chrome, but if I overdo it then it'll switch one too many tabs. My cheap M325 is better at scrolling. Probably just get rid of this one and buy another M325. This thing is just nothing but hype and marketing.",24-Apr-20
1730,Jordan Molina,5,"I bought the Logitech MX Master. A while later, my father bought the MX Master 2S. I was jealous. Now I have the MX Master 3 and he is the jealous one. We were able to test out the 3. The first generation and second are very similar. Battery life lasts a very long time on all of them. The main difference that I noticed was the fact that you can move through 2 computers and bring over the clipboard. Amazing feature. I have not tried it on mine yet, however, my father uses it on his all the time. A huge difference between the 3 and the 2 is the actual layout is a bit different. It has a way better ergonomic layout. Feels so much better. Would definitely recommend. Very comfortable to use even after extended time periods",23-Apr-20

I use 3 monitors 24, 27, 24"" side by side, so I need the mouse to  cover the screen space easily. maybe a little more scroll sensitivity needed there.",21-Apr-20
1734,Joshmer de Mesa,4,The MagSpeed scroll wheel works great! It's great when you're scrolling through lines of code. Bought this with the MX Keys as a bundle and they work well together. Could've been great if they included the palm rest when buying the bundle though,19-Apr-20
1735,Joshua H. Sheskin,4,"I like this mouse, I own two of them, and I did replace two MX Master 2s with them. However, after months of use of the first, and weeks of use of the second, I can say that they are not much better than the MX Master 2s.  Sure the scrolling speed is amazing, and it is not to terribly uncomfortable, however they should have added an extra notch to rest an extra finger on. I got used to the backward and forward commands on my 2s, I do not find this one that much easier, but if you are not used to the 2s you will find the backward and forward commands much easier.I like the feel of the mouse, although I wish you could put more of your hand on it. The backward and forward buttons are better if you are not already used to the 2s, and charging with a C Cable improves charging time dramatically. It switches between computers better than my old 2s, but they still did the job. However, it also has way better tracking than my 2s on odd surfaces that are not my desk, like my leg, or bed.In the end it is an improvement on what was already a very good mouse. If your employer is going to pay for the upgrade then jump all over it. However, if you have to shell out 100 dollars on a mouse, and you have the previous model, you already have a great mouse, and you may be dissappointed that this model is only a slight improvement.",19-Apr-20
1736,A. Rydin,5,"I've almost elusively used ""gaming mice"" because good ones need to do a lot of things well to match the precision needed for some games, eve if I'm using it mostly for other things.I bought this when I started a new job for its ability to quickly switch between multiple devices; I can switch between my personal PC, work laptop, and iPad with the touch of a button. Granted, this button is on the bottom of the mouse, so you do need to lift it up and turn it over to press it. I'm not sure if that is an oversight, or intentional to avoid accidentally pressing the button. Either way, its still the fastest and easiest way that I know of to switch a mouse between devices. You can even configure it to control both computers at the same time with logitech's software, but I didn't find that as reliable.When I first got it I had issues with disconnects, where I'd have to unpair and re-pair the mouse to fix it. I made sure the firmware was updated and followed all Logitech's posted troubleshooting. So I was  slightly annoyed when I reached out to their support team  and in response just got a copy/paste of the support articles I told them I had already read. But it ended up being a non-issue, as the disconnect issue went away on its own , at least for now.The battery is outstanding. I use it basically all day every day, and have only had to charge it maybe 2 times since I got it in early February.Once in a while the mouse will lock up for a second or two. Its a minor annoyance 99% of the time, but it can be a serious deal-breaker in games like shooters. I still keep my wired Corsair mouse nearby for these types of games.The ergonomics are excellent. The thumb rest is great to keep your thumb from dragging on whatever surface you are on, and the thumb buttons are perfectly placed. Speaking of surfaces, tracking is excellent on every surface I've tried; it works about as well on my leg as it does on my mouse pad.But maybe the best thing about this mouse is the scroll wheel. It is, in a word, delightful. It has two modes controlled by the button in front of it. In one, there is basically no friction at all, the smoothest scrolling wheel I've ever used. Press the button, and now when you scroll slowly, there will be clicks to help you scroll in steps start scrolling faster, and the friction melts away. I frequently find myself spinning the wheel just to time how long it will go on until it stops (20 second record, beat that). The side scroll wheel doesn't have the same magic, and often doesn't seem to be supported. But it's still useful where it works.Overall, it's a great mouse. If you can only have one mouse and you play fast paced games, you should probably look elsewhere. Otherwise, you really can't go wrong, and if you have multiple devices you'd like to control, it's a no-brainer.",18-Apr-20
1737,kspano,4,"Understand I am not a gamer, I use the mouse for work in industrial environments where the work surfaces are not always an ideal desktop.  That was the  main reason I choose this mouse to begin with.  It works fantastic on all sorts of surfaces including dusty, stainless, shiny, painted, pitted, etc.  I can go from clean quartz counter top to a nasty toolbox and this thing doesn't miss a beat.I had the 2S until it broke.  The left main button broke of in my laptop bag.  The reason it broke it because unlike most simple mice packages, the buttons on this mouse hang off the front of the unit.  This is the part that frustrates me.  If you simply throw it into a pocket in a laptop bag and it gets squished, it can break.  Ask me how I know.  So, when I bought the new MX 3, I also purchased a small digital camera case and I now put it in the case before I throw it in the laptop bag.The other, and more important reason I have a complaint with this otherwise fantastic mouse is this.  Since, as I mentioned, the buttons on the mouse hang over the front of the unit, if you are using the mouse and the front of the unit bumps into something, it clicks the mouse.  I have had numerous times where I bump into a coffee cup, a notebook, the front of my laptop, a monitor stand, etc. and the buttons get clicked.  Granted, I work in an area less than ideal, I get it, but I don't recall ever having this issue with any other mouse that I have owned.  Maybe someone from Logitech will see this and version 4 will be different!I still love it though...",17-Apr-20

It impresses a lot of my colleagues.However, I cannot use this mouse on my Macbook. It stutters and jumps all over the place. When I'm scrolling, the mouse skips from one side of the screen to the other - even when using the included dongle. People say that ""you have to have the dongle in very close proximity to the mouse"", but I shouldn't have to modify my work desk layout just to get this mouse to work as intended, especially at that premium price.I might keep it for work, but I purchased this mouse to use across all my devices, and that just isn't doable here.

1744,John Hackert,2,"I need to write a poor review for this device, for the sake of those who might be considering its purchase, and for Logitech to take note if it cares to hear. I relied on the MX Revolution for years until my last one finally wore out. The ""MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse"" seemed to be the best replacement option. I would agree with other reviewers that the ergonomics are a step backward and the software is dumbed down. Most disappointingly, I've found that this mouse frequently disconnects from the receiver such that the enhanced featureset is lost, even though it's still recognized as a basic mouse by Windows. Decided to give the connect-by-Bluetooth option a try but hours later Bluetooth completely disappeared in Device Manager, which persistently reported ""Unknown USB device (device descriptor request failed)"" despite attempted uninstalls/driver updates/etc. Via email rather than telephone per their request, Logitech's technical support department seemed like children without their parents around, lacking any accountability. They requested, reasonably, the various specs, like ""Operating system version, edition, and build,"" to which I replied ""Windows 10 Pro, Version 1909, OS Build 18363.657,"" but their response was ""Thanks for getting back. Please confirm your computer operating system."" I asked for a supervisor's involvement; Logitech Customer Support suggested I conduct troubleshooting. Of course I had already documented running the recommended algorithm without resolution. Through my own independent research I was at last able to restore Bluetooth functionality on a suggestion to temporarily unplug the power cord, of all things.",14-Apr-20
1745,Harlie Y.,2,Kinda disappointed. I wanted to like this soooo bad. The feel of this mouse is great but it is SO jittery. I was using a Magic Mouse before this and have switched back and forth when I’m too sick of this stupid thing not working right. I’ve tried on multiple computers / different places /usb connectors and it’s always so jittery. Pretty disappointing for the price.The scroll is nice and it’s comfortable. The battery life is good too. But the jittery ness i can’t get past. I’m a graphic designer so I need accuracy and this just doesn’t work for that.,13-Apr-20
1746,Dave P.,4,"My hand measures about 9''. And my fingers aren't really that long. So when I grip the mouse, I do have to reach ever so slightly to click the L or R buttons. Most of the time, I'm pressing the buttons usually dead center. The gesture control isn't smooth. But it's a neat feature. I wish the scroll wheel for ups and down, is angled ever so slightly to the right like the way the mouse is shaped. Otherwise my middle finger rests flat while the other two rests slightly to the right making it feel somewhat uncomfortable. Overall, the mouse is attractive, feels nice to the touch, and it's well made. Love that the scroll wheel is quiet and smooth. But I don't think it's worth $99. For small hand like mine, perhaps the Anywhere 2S may have been better. If that had a horizontal wheel, I would've chosen it over the MX Master 3.",12-Apr-20
1747,Super T,2,This mouse worked well for about 2 months. Now it prevents left mouse clicks the moment I turn it on - and this happens on 3 separate devices. I've reset default settings over 10 times using my touch screen since it also destroys my laptop mousepad. That gets it to work for maybe a minute sometimes and then bam - unusable.I have to turn of the mouse and reboot my computer to get functionality back.And this happens the MOMENT I turn the mouse on.I've reverted back to older versions of this and other Logitech mice (is that used right?) that allow you to switch between 3 devices and they thankfully all work.,11-Apr-20

It's incredibly well made, even more so than the one I've used for 8 years now, and fits perfectly in my hand. Programmability is fantastic and it has been a blast to use with SolidWorks / CAD large files without any lag. Everything about it is well designed, and I absolutely think I will have this one for many years too. If you are a heavy computer user the value of a good mouse is huge. Highly recommend.",11-Apr-20

The scroll wheel has a good weight to it, and the ability to free spin is invaluable.. until it decides to free spin 100% of the time.  Now it is stuck in free spin mode and I cannot get it to lock whatever I do.  That pretty much rendered this $100 mouse worthless since just moving the mouse will cause the wheel to scroll without any resistance to keep it from turning.",11-Apr-20

Spin 5 times to move an a quarter inch. Want to scroll up again? Spin 5 times and bam you've now scrolled half the page. I am mostly annoyed by the scrolling up. Scrolling down is somewhat consistent, but even doing that has its problem. Physically it feels fine when scrolling. It is clearing a problem with the software controlling the scrolling distance. Also you seemingly cant turn smart shift all the way off. Even in its ""off"" state it still will switch from ratcheting to free spin.",9-Apr-20

1755,Lawrence T. Bennett,3,"Received the MX 3 ten days ago. My biggest complaint is the Gesture button (thumb button). I've used the original Performance mouse for years - and in several applications (e.g. Blender 3D, GIMP) I've used my thumb for ""Middle Mouse Button."" On the MX3 it takes two men and a boyscout to press-and-hold the button down, and I'm constantly uttering words usually reserved for sailors! I hate having to use the scroll wheel button - especially in Blender - since trying to press or release it can unintentionally cause scrolling the view in/out.My second biggest complaint: it seems to forget your personal preferences for buttons. In Firefox, I have the Back/Forward buttons programmed to Ctrl+W and Ctrl+TAB. Occasionally, the front button switches to Forward, and the rear button to Ctrl+W. Yeah, THAT'S convenient! I actually have to close/open Firefox before it resets to my preferences.Yes, it feels different than the awesome original design - but I can live with it. After ten days, it's no longer noticed (much). But I love the personalization of the controls - ►WHEN they work◄.",5-Apr-20
1756,Jacob Hinkston,5,"I am a big techy. I write code, I edit videos and pictures. I also browse Reddit a lot. This mouse made me better at all fo the things (Reddit is important too). Scrolling through 1,000+ line code related files, and panning through lightroom pictures, I found it not only very intuitive but comfortable and fast. The mouse wheel is most impressive, I love the switch between free-spin and locked-spin. It gives you some options depending on what you are doing. I also like the included USB adapter to connect a second or even third device. I have a mac and a Linux box (No Bluetooth), so being able to switch between the two machines made my life so much easier. The secondary thumb button is nice, I can use it in macOS to open Mission Control on mac, OR I can use it to switch between applications in linux.Gaming? I tried it. For certain games, it will be ok. If you play a fast MOBA or MMORPG, it will be more difficult.All in all, this mouse is the jack of all trades, master of all. The MX3 is the best mouse I have ever bought.

1759,S G Bansraj,1,"The Logitech MX Master 3 has received a lot of praise for its features, design and functionality. Having actually used it for several months, I can say that the value I've received does not match up to the price.The SmartShift feature which automatically shifts the scroll wheel from a ratchet mechanism to a free-spinning mode isn't useful at all. In fact, it was annoying enough for me to disable it. I chose to manually shift between the modes with a button on top the device. Then the button stopped working and I was stuck with only one mode.Aside from the free-spinning scroll wheel, the other features were mostly unused by me. The side scroll wheel is mostly useless and sometimes annoying when you accidentally touch it. I sometimes use the back button when browsing websites.I had high hopes for this device, but was ultimately let down. I can't recommend the Logitech MX Master 3 and probably won't pick up another Logitech device.Pros:* The free-spinning scroll wheel is nice* Rechargeable battery with long life* Ergonomic design* Wireless connectivity is goodCons:* Expensive* SmartShift is a useless gimmick* Sometimes malfunctions* Manual scroll wheel mode shift button stopped working after only a few months of use",30-Mar-20
1760,Reader,2,"BEWARE IF BUYING FOR AN iPAD!!  I bought this after watching a YouTube review where it was used with an iPro and iPad OS.  The reviewed iPad was connected to a keyboard and everything seemed to work fine, including the MX Master 3 mouse.  However, after connecting this mouse to my 2020 model iPad Pro via bluetooth, I discovered that the on-screen keyboard would no longer display.  This makes the mouse unusable for me since I don’t have an external iPad keyboard.  So, beware that this limitation if you plan on using it with an iPad.  It might not be an issue for you if you will always have an external keyboard connected.  I did trouble shooting with Apple Support and they concluded that the mouse is not compatible with iPadOS13.4.  The mouse did work well with my Windows 10 PCs.  Hopefully, Logitech will do a firmware update to make fully compatible with iPadOS 13.4 so it doesn’t impact the on-screen keyboard.",29-Mar-20

Very responsive clicks and precise sensor.Battery life has also been great - have only charged once in the first few months.Would say that the one area I see for improvement is the ability to have the mouse sync up with the keyboard, so when you switch between connected computers/devices by clicking the appropriate device on the keyboard, the mouse will switch as well. Currently you have to manually click to switch devices on the mouse as well, which is a bit inconvenient given the device swap button is on the bottom of the mouse.",23-Mar-20

The battery lasts for months.<br>Sometimes the scroll wheel gets a little overzealous -- you scroll down and the mouse seems to think you meant to scroll to the of a 1000 page document -- but it doesn't happen often and it is only a minor inconvenience.I'd honestly love to switch between connected computers without having to flip over the mouse, but now I'm just being selfish.This is a great mouse.  It is the best I've ever used.</br>",15-Mar-20

1795,Sibelius,4,"Admittedly it took me a few work days to get used to this mouse as previously I've been accustomed to slimmer, more svelte devices. First impression was that this was a very chunky mouse. It sits wide and tall and and sort of embraces the entirety of your hand to use properly. That said, once you get used to it the cradling sensation becomes natural and comfortable and soon enough you'll be acclimated to it and will then marvel at its range of functionality and customization that really takes this one to the next level.For starters battery life is exceptional (USB-C charging) and when in a pinch you can fast charge this for a few minutes to get a full days use out of it. Tracking is amazing as well and in my work/leisure I use desktop/laptop setups in a wide range of environments and have typically lugged a mouse pad to insure usage on less than ideal surfaces. With this device - mouse pad is no longer necessary and have used it on surfaces ranging from chipped wood, coarse sheet metal and glass surfaces to great effect and proper precision. Customization is great provided that you install Logitech's device software and allows me to quickly and easily switch between 3 devices (my current setup = windows desktop, windows laptop, Macbook). But perhaps my favorite feature of all is the ability to cut/copy files on my computer and seamlessly paste to another device/OS. For someone like me that bounces between a variety of devices this feature alone is worth the price of admission.",7-Mar-20

I have giant hands and it feels perfect in my palm, even more-so than the original MX mouse.BUT...Side scroll works in just about every other application but Excel and Logitech Options either does not open fully (sits stuck on a blank screen) or will not recognize the mouse so I can't use any features that are part of the application.I had always loved Logitech products but this is making me never want to purchase one again.",6-Mar-20
1798,WillBuyThatForADollar,5,"I'm on a computer working or for fun basically 24 hours a day and have gone through many periods of time where my hand/wrist aches or is in some sort of pain due to constant usage of a mouse.Needed a new mouse and saw this one in stores with the slight angle, figured it was worth a shot to try with other great reviews but it was pretty expensive for a non-gaming mouse. Figuring I could return it, I bought one at Staples and now a few months later I realized how my wrist feels great finally making the connection it's probably this mouse and the angle. The wheels are perfect and I get zero lag using the usb dongle (haven't tried bluetooth).Also the battery life is NUTS.... since owning it i've probably only charged it for a few hours twice... I'm also not a much of a review writer so for me to make this effort for an item is pretty honorable!",6-Mar-20
1799,Voytek M. Jarnot,3,"Initial impressions after a couple of hours:TL;DR: Logitech - All you have do to is bring back the MX Revolution and tart it up with the new scroll wheel (the main one, leave the thumbwheel as-is), Bluetooth, and USB C. That's it. Keep it simple, and stop foisting these ergonomic misses on your customers.After well over a dozen years, I'm unwilling to once more open up my MX Revolution and fix the left-click. This is the next best thing, which isn't saying as much as one would think. Mayhaps the Logitech product designers could ask their parents to let them look at and touch some older Logitech mice for inspiration.Pluses:- Bluetooth seems to actually work, unlike previous MX Master iterations.- USB C charging is niceMinuses:- USB C charging, but USB A dongle? Genius!- Ergonomics: this mouse brings to mind Chris Walken's little speech from Pulp Fiction- Buttons: gesture button is too far out to the side, forward/back buttons are too far toward the back, thumbwheel is ok but the MX Revolution was better in the sense that it could act as middle click- Mouse body: why in the name of all that is holy does the back of the mouse swoop upwards? What sort of anatomical freak finds that comfortable?",5-Mar-20

1804,Amazon Customer,5,"I've been using this mouse for about a month now.I recently switched from Mac to PC and needed a mouse that would replicate the Magic Mouse from Apple.As a video editor, horizontal scrolling in my timeline is super important.On top of that, ergonomics need to be perfect, as I'm using it for 8-12 to sometimes 16 hours at a time.It's got all the functions that the magic mouse offered plus some. It's also much more comfortable.If you're a video editor, I would highly suggest this mouse. If you're looking for a gaming mouse, don't get this mouse.Also the battery life is amazing. I haven't had to charge it once in the month of steady use. Apparently it has fast charging as well. Something like one minute for 3 hours of use. That's insane!! and will come in handy for sure.",3-Mar-20
1805,Patrick LaFollette,5,"Might be a little large for some grips. Not really meant for gaming, haven't tried it for that. Logitech Options software very good for customization.Nitpick: the button on the side thumb flat area is a little hard to actuate, but that may be my own personal ergonomics. I wouldn't mind if there were one more thumb-accessible button, maybe inside the horizontal scroll wheel, but that's not a big deal.",3-Mar-20
1806,Paolo L.,5,"I must say, I was extremely hesitant to spend this much on a mouse, but after buying a bunch of various ones and returning them for one reason or another, I ended up getting the Apple Magic Mouse 2, the priciest mouse I've ever bought prior to this one. That mouse was almost perfect except it was extremely uncomfortable after extended use intervals and the scrolling would do weird things sometimes. I returned it and continued my search. The MX Master 3 was the only one I hadn't tried, so I finally gave up and shelled out the $100 for this mouse and I have to say I don't regret it one bit.This mouse is comfortable, functional, customizable to your liking, and has great build quality. My favorite parts are definitely the stainless steel magnetic scroll wheels both up top and on the side near the thumb rest. You can set it for free spin or incremental scrolling. The wheels remain heavy on both modes, which conveys that expensive device feel. Then, there's an incognito gesture button right by the thumb as well that is very useful to navigate around MacOS. I also love the flexibility of either connecting with the Logitech unifying receiver or bluetooth, since the new MacBooks only have USB C ports now. The device switching button hidden underneath is also a plus. My search has definitely ended. This mouse blows every other one out of the water, then eats their little mouse souls.If I had to nitpick, I'd say the price is too high. If Logitech wanted to charge this much, they should have made every part of this mouse special like how they focused and made the scroll wheels special. The clicking of the buttons should also feel like the $100 you spent on this device, but they just feel like normal clickers.",3-Mar-20

1810,Bruce,3,"This mouse is nice looking, rechargeable, accurate and ergonomic.The scroller is made from what looks to be aluminum. It is difficult to scroll a small amount (there are no minimum clicks).The main buttons are super super loud. I have a secondary silent mouse that I use at night, or when I am annoying myself and others with the loud snapping click of the mouse.The other buttons are nicely placed.Not sure what the reason behind the intentionally loud click is for?",29-Feb-20
1811,Tom Lynch,5,"I have had a lot of mouses. Right before this had an insignia blue tooth and it kept snagging on my desktop and It was hard-ish to click. This MX master 3 is awesome. At first the size, it looked a little big. But it really fits my hand well. One of the coolest features is the auto-scroll by type. When you want a fast smooth roll for the entire page it does it automatically with a little flick of the finger up or down. If you scroll slowly it goes back to normal incremental line specifed, stepped scrolls. Suttle and quiet unlike some other mouses with similar features. And you don't have to click the scroll wheel done to change the type of scroll. The clicks are subtle but explicit. No real effort and not hair-trigger either. The side to side scroll is handy with big excel sheets. Love this mouse!",28-Feb-20
1812,Borszczuk Myanmar,3,"This is really great mouse. Feels right, not cheap, weights right, but... There's one thing that made me return it - the wheel and how it acts. The wheel is silent and can spin almost forever and this leads to usability problems like: you spin the wheel to i.e. scroll the web page in browser, then you move your pointer over to other browser or terminal window, press qualifier like i.e. ALT and.... you got your font size instantly increased from 12px to 200px just because you forgot to manually stop the wheel from spinning and ALT+wheel is combination for zoom. Even I knew how this works it sill happened multiple times to me, on literally daily basis. It is extremely annoying and overshadows all the joy you can otherwise get by using this mouse. Other (minor) issue is that there's a special button located on thumb rest area that you are supposed to press with your thumb. But it is located so odd, that using thumb tip is uncomfortable and thumb joint is odd. Sad but I returned it. Will git a try when they release  MX 4 though.",27-Feb-20
1813,Will,5,I use mouse over 10 hours a day. This mouse is the best one I have ever used. Cursor control is very stable. Left click and dragging are not interrupted. No heated feeling on hand after a long time of use.,27-Feb-20
1814,TexasD00d,1,"I'm on Win10 and using the included wireless receiver. Every 45 minutes or so the mouse decides to completely drop connectivity for around 3s and it does this about a dozen times before it settles back down.I did contact Logitech support and they were abysmal.As for remediation, reinstalling the drivers and management software three times did nothing. I was not able to find anything that would interfere with the signal (the receiver is inches away from the mouse pad). I changed the USB extension cable for the receiver.So as a wireless mouse, and I can't speak to Bluetooth, this mouse is awful and it is essentially worthless if you wish to game with it.Everything else about it seems nice. Just wish it worked. YMMV.",27-Feb-20
1815,Chris Jackson,3,"This mouse has so much potential to be great. The form factor, battery life, and feature (on paper) are all great, but I don't think I've ever had this much trouble with a wireless mouse. As many others have pointed out, scrolling is a pretty inconsistent mess, and horizontal scrolling even more so. It is extremely comfortable to use for the design work I do, but every now and then, the mouse will become unresponsive, and I have to power cycle it.If it weren't for these connectivity and scrolling issues, this would be a perfect mouse for me, but these are huge factors that are holding it back, especially for the price point.",27-Feb-20
1816,Thomas Mcginty,5,"So far I am in love with this mouse! There are 5 buttons on this mouse that can each be assigned to 5 gestures( up, down, left, right, and just a single click of said button). Each gesture is can be custom mapped to perform a different action chosen from a long list of actions. This gives you a possibility of 25 actions you can perform just from your mouse, and that doesn't even include the left click, right click or scrolling features! I have said good by to most of my hot keys.Also, you don't have to map each button on your mouse to perform gestures. You could simply assign each button to perform 1 action each if you so choose.The scroll wheel is AMAZING.It can pair up to 3 devices and if you have come this far, you probably already know about the flow feature. If not just google Logitech Flow.I gave it 4 stars for the ergonomics because although it is very comfortable, a vertical design would be the most ergonomic. 2 stars for gaming because it is not designed for gaming at all, it is designed for productivity. Overall, I think this product deserves 5 stars just for the shear amount of productivity that can be accomplished with this mouse.",26-Feb-20

1824,M. Service,4,"I have used an Apple Magic Mouse for years and loved it. My old one I had for 8 years until it started to finally die. So, I started shopping, well really looking at reviews for what else is good. The Logitech MX Master 3 Seemed to be at the top of the list. Checked my goto guy for tech reviews Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) and sure enough he likes it, so I bought one. And? Very good. I forgot how having specific buttons makes it easier to use. No, I don’t use it for gaming so can’t really address that. But, for surfing, post photo or video work, and music editing it works very well. Ergonomics it’s not bad. I do have an issues with it kind’a running away from me. But, that could be just me getting used to it. This is a great mouse. But, at $100.00 that might be a bit too much for some; and I don’t disagree. If you only want a mouse for basics then I wouldn’t really recommend it. You can get a very good mouse for a lot less. But, if your on the computer a lot and do more than check email and social media then I do recommend it.",23-Feb-20

The only thing I don't like is that neither work as a wired device.  I work in IT at home and work and I don't like having different keyboards for both environments.  My work does not allow wireless input devices so I have to get another keyboard and mouse for work.  I just wish Logitech would make it so their products, which can be connected via USB, would work via USB.  Otherwise, the keyboard is amazingly easy to get used to and this mouse has great functionality.

I just returned a G502 Hero Gaming mouse (to another retailer), due to the LEFT click button being too sensitive (kept double clicking) and the scroll wheel was like rolling a bowling ball through gravel.  I ordered the MX Master 3 from Amazon.  The scroll wheel was great but sadly the LEFT clicker was just as bad as the G502 Hero...way too sensitive.  Thankfully Amazon made it easy and hassle-free to return for a credit.  So while my old G500 still works (but looks rough), the two new mice I've tried are sub par accordingly.

1839,Benjamin G. Cousins,1,I was sent a used MX Master 2S in a MX Master 3 box before I returned it to get the MX Master 3 I ordered. Turns out they added macro buttons to the new model to go back and forth through web pages. These macro buttons are useless on a Mac and just serve to distract from how amazing this mouse is for use in Adobe products like Photoshop. This particular mouse is terribly designed with poor ergonomics. Everything good about the 2S was ruined in this design.,19-Feb-20
1840,Amazon Customer,5,This mouse is amazing for workflow and productivity. Being able to map the buttons for certain applications is amazing.

1842,Timothy Arens,5,"I originally bought the S2 for work and loved it so much that i wanted to buy another for my Home computer.  I saw that they had a newer ver.3 out so i Bought this one for home.  I use it ALL the time.  Bought back in January and i run it for 10+ hours a day and turn it off when my day is done.  Only needed to charge it 3 times in 8 months.  I have large hands so the Ergonomics are Fantastic and fit me like a glove but i can see how people with small hands would find this uncomfortable.  The customization of the side scroll wheel is great and the tactile feel of the scroll wheel makes me feel in control.There is only one thing I see wrong with this mouse which is what prompted me to write this Review.  For the past 3 days (the month of August 2020) I've noticed that every so often my mouse Stutters.  Sometimes while gaming the mouse is Smooth as melted butter, and sometimes when working in a Chrome browser it stops responding for half a second and I end up miss clicking because of it.  I'm not sure if the receiver dongle is dying or the mouse itself is dying, could be environmental (Maybe my mouse pad is dirty)  but it only seems to do it while NOT gaming.It never occurred to me this happened with my S2 at work until it started happening with my Home mouse since before i bought this one I ordered a new Logi Dongle for my work mouse.  I thought putting my laptop in my bag every day for work might have damaged the dongle  on the S2.  Now that its happening with my Home mouse in a desktop that doesn't move I'm beginning to think the Dongles have a limited life?  Not sure.I'm still giving this 5/5 stars despite the dongle problem since that could be remedied by buying a 13$ replacement dongle.",16-Feb-20

1845,Amazon Customer,5,"Logitech has truly improved their product.My previous MX Master 2S thumb scroll wheel had an annoying bit of ""slack"" before feeling like it was doing anything. Not just response lag, but a physical looseness that would take almost a 1/4 of a stroke to start feeling like there was any resistance in rotating an internal mechanism... very hard to describe, but if you have a 2S, you know the feeling. It was even more sad that the $30 VicTsing Pioneer mouse sold on Amazon had a more direct feeling thumb wheel. Well, Logitechs back on top... This MX3 thumb wheel is AMAZING. A nicely weighted and direct feel. No slack or looseness and just overall feels more robust. It's now a pleasure to use.The overall shape of the 2S was visually more appealing to me, but the MX3 feels ergonomically superior in every way. It has a more aggressive cant to it, feeling more natural in the palm. The size is just barely smaller than the 2S, a welcome change for me as it fits my hand much better where the S2 felt a touch too large.The MX3 palm to thumb rest material is softer. The front/back buttons just above your thumb feel better placed and more usable than the S2 design, where those buttons were cleverly diagonally separated... it was a neat look, but this one is a bit more intuitive to use. A more “second nature” feel.The main scroll wheel feels better too! The new magnetic auto-catch system is a pleasure to experience, more refined than the ""clutch dump"" feeling of the 2S. It has a more muted noise in ratchet mode... but I tend to leave it on speed scroll mode as it feels better suited for my Mac that way. Maybe it's just me, but the on screen scrolling is better matched to what you're doing on the mouse as well.There's a recess in the hard plastic frame below the thumb/gesture button this time... With that relief cut, the press feels easier to accomplish. I felt like I needed to put more effort behind my thumb to get that button pressed on the 2S - though I've oddly read other peoples experience to be the opposite of mine on here... For me, this is a nice update.Overall, this mouse knocks it out of the park. It looks like an ""uglier"" new model, but once it's in your palm, you'll be changing your tune so fast and knocking the 2S for being pretty, but useless in comparison. The MX3 feels like an extension of your body - ESPECIALLY if you felt the 2S was just slightly too big for you.One little annoyance... The mouse isn't compatible with scrolling in my MacOS Calendar... Here's to hoping a software revision will fix that down the line.",15-Feb-20

This was in October, now in February there is a VERY noticeable deformation in the rubber that has started to fall through a hole in the plastic. It feels wrong and catches my thumb every time. I wonder how does Logitech test its products if they allowed such a poor design choice to get approved. I had no such problems with the previous gen. My use case is simple office use, although I do use all the buttons the mouse provides for shortcuts.Apart from the physical flaw, the thumb button is harder to use compared to the previous gen, and when you use the lateral scroll your thumb will always brush against the two small buttons beneath it, lately I've also noticed the scroll wheel skip some lines periodically, but you get used to these things.",14-Feb-20

It is better in almost every respect than the Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 which it replaced.  The fit to the hand is very good.  The buttons are easy to reach and work well.  The mouse is adjustable for almost every function.  The best part is I don't have to run out and buy batteries.  The mouse warns me when the batter is getting low and I simply plug it into a USB port, the same as with a mobile phone.",12-Feb-20
1852,Jelly Face,3,"Logitech options is probably the least stable software I've used at any point in my life, all the way back to the XP days. I've been on my computer 20 minutes and it already stopped working. Smart shift isn't smart at all, it's a HUGE hindrance and since the mouse has no built-in memory every time the software stops working the mouse reverts to it's horrible defaults. I've never gotten options to function for more than an hour. I was hoping the issues would be gone from the MX 2s but if anything they've gotten worse. If not for the software this would be the perfect mouse.I got a $20 Fenifox wireless combo as a backup a few months ago, good thing I did. Far less pleasant in-hand yet more functional.",11-Feb-20

1854,Sean,5,"i have been a MX master user ever since the first version. and i didn't know much can be improved when the MX master 3 launched lately. however, i bought one anyways just because.and boy am i impressed.in my opinion, this mouse actually looks less attractive than original MX and MX 2s. where the old MX got that sports car look, the master 3 look a lot more mild with a lot of asymmetric design. however, it does prove to be a better ergonomic  design than the previous two.the main thing it improved upon previous generations are1. battery indicator, now is at a much more obvious place.2. navigation button, now is much easier to reach.3. the thumb pad button.  now it actually felt like a button (i wouldn't be surprised most MX users doesn't even know there is a thumb pad button).4. and most importantly, scrolling wheel feel. it destroies the old MX.  for one, the entire wheel is metal. it feels nice when you use it. and the scrolling action is so smooth and quite, it is gliding. the motion is that much tighter feeling, simply out of this world.5. USB C. yes, finally, USB C for all my devices.6. file copy over multiple machines? haven't tried, but looks pretty awesome.there is one con that i must point out is that by moving the navigation button under the side scrolling wheel, it is harder to reach the side scrolling wheel, especially when you want to move the mouse at the same time. you can no longer preciously move the mouse when your thumb is on the side scrolling, which could drive someone crazy if he/she use this function all the time.",11-Feb-20
1855,Antal Ullmann,5,"Excellent product, at first it was a bit strange since they moved the side buttons and the scroll wheel, but after you get used to it, it actually feels like they are in better locations anyways. Works like if not better than the 2. Highly recommended.",10-Feb-20
1856,Shawn,5,"The big selling point is the scroll wheel. In older logitech mice with metal scroll wheels, you pressed a button to switch back and forth between ratchet mode and free spinning mode. But with this, you don't have to do that. It's ratchet when you go slowly, and then if you spin it hard, it goes into free spinning. You might have to try it to appreciate how nice that it. Very easily the best mouse I've had in decades of using mice. I don't use it for games, so I can't comment on that, but for regular PC work, it's great.",10-Feb-20

1858,Connor,5,"This mouse has a very premium feel to it. Not only that but it's actually worth the price tag for the somewhat unique features it offers.My only complaint with this is my own doing for not looking into it further happens to be the scroll wheel. While very usable in a productivity and performance setting, it can take some getting used to if you plan on playing any sort of game that requires a scroll wheel. The Logitech software allows some of the functionality of the mouse to be changed or shut off but software can't change the physically different pieces of the mechanisms. This mouse scrolls large bits of things EXTREMELY WELL. When it comes to swapping between slot 1 and 2 in a hot bar for example, you'll start to see the struggle of using this new type of scroll wheel.",8-Feb-20
1859,public name_here(),4,"All of this is subjective, but this mouse is not as comfortable for me as the previous ones I have owned (MX Revolution, Performance MX, Master 2S). The arch is much higher (it seems to get higher with each iteration), so if you like to keep your palm flatter, you'll have to adapt a bit. I personally think the Master/Master 2S design is the most comfortable for me, but YMMV. HOWEVER, out of the box, the scroll wheel sensitivity seems to match exactly what I am looking for. Previous models have never quite detected when I was trying to scroll fast vs slow, and I would overcompensate to force it into glide mode, making it pretty useless. The tactile feedback on the scroll is more subtle than the 2S... I would compare it to the Performance MX, but at this point its so old the Performance might just be worn out. I'm glad they went back to the front/back buttons for forward and back instead of the over/under on the Master series... it was closer to where my finger was, but it wasn't quite clear which I was pressing and I did so with trepidation. I bought this to replace my home mouse with the intention of bringing the 2S to work, but since most of my scrolling is data at work, I may be forced to bring this fancy new mouse into the office.",8-Feb-20

1861,Brian Zhou,1,"The scroll wheel feels good in the hand but when you actually go to use it, it is not nearly as responsive as a normal scroll wheel.I'm a videographer/editor and I use Premiere Pro often, so when it comes to being precise it's important to be able to scroll quickly to get to the part of the timeline I want. It works when it wants and is highly frustrating to use.If you aren't using this for productivity, I think it is a pretty good mouse (though feels pretty heavy compared to most mice). But if you are consistently using the scroll wheel for excel or other applications for work, I would suggest looking elsewhere.Hope this helps someone!",8-Feb-20

1868,Randall PeQueen,5,"The 'app specific' feature is really nice BUT...If the respective app is open then the other features will not work.For example... I use the thumb button in a custom manner so that I push down and swipe the mouse to open pages and tools that I set up.But when I have any of the apps open that I set for specific features, the swipe function is gone until I close the app.Not even swiping it on the second monitor, or outside the app window, will allow the features to come back... ONLY closing the app will then bring back the common features I set.The app specific feature ability is AWESOME other than that. I do a lot of photoshop and MS Office and those features would be awesome to use. I have turned them off though because of the above.Maybe an update to the software?I have MX Master previous editions on each of my 3 office PCs and my PC at home.The placement of the thumb wheel on this new one makes me have to lift my thumb to operate it but I got used to the wheel just being right there with the MX regulars. I use the thumb wheel for volume because I have to turn it up and down often depending on what clients are in the office and where. Yes, I know... boo hoo I have to lift my thumb... but comfort and seamless operation is what we spend the extra money for.The thumb button is further back on the mouse than the previous ones as well, so I am having to pull my thumb back to use it where as before I didn't have to.So with this mouse I am having to manipulate my thumb where before I barely had to move it at all.It's not a deal killer ... but if I had to do it again, I'd wait for the next gen.The scroll wheel is awesome. Much smoother and the tactile feedback is much nicer if you can imagine, almost as if it's the vibrating haptic feedback on a smart-phone. Really nice and silent.All in all it's as nice as the ones before it but not as ergonomic in my opinion... for my hand anyway.I'm sending it back for a replacement because the I could juuust barely feel it click when I left click and most of the time not at all, and that drives me crazy. Almost feels like it's not doing anything. I have grown to like, and even depend on the haptics and also the sound of the click on a mouse.*** Got the new one now and the click is perfect***The right click is fine.Some people actually will get silent ones intentionally but they still want to feel it click.A 'dead' click might sound stupid but it would be a deal breaker with me.My overall recommendation:If you have been an MX Master user for a while already I'd wait for the next gen MX Master and hope the placement of the thumb wheel and thumb button is back better and that the apps will allow the stock functions to work at the same time.If you have never used an MX Master then you will LOVE this mouse and it's worth every penny.",6-Feb-20

1870,H.S.,5,"Let's get this out of the way; this is NOT a mouse designed for gaming. However, it covers this area well enough, for the average/casual gamer. It is heavier than most mice (and gaming mice), and doesn't have the higher dpi that most gaming mice have.That said, if you need a mouse for everything else, absolutely nothing else comes close!Do you know what I love holding in my hands? No, not that. My woman! I love holding my woman in my hands. She fits in my hands perfectly. Oh how I love her... I say all of that to say, I love holding this mouse more! Holding this mouse is orgasmic. But seriously though, it has perfect ergonomics. It is slightly more upright than most mice, but nowhere near to vertical mice. Some people may love that, others may dislike it, and others may not care. Personally, I love it. There's a little bit of pinky-finger drag, but that's common in most mice.It's made for bigger hands, so if your hands are very small, you may have difficulty holding it *is what I told her ;)*Design and Build -This thing is built beautifully, and the colour (matte grey) is nice. The soft touch material is comfortable, and doesn't collect/trap much dust. A simple wipe with the palm of your hand is enough to clean it off. The metal scroll wheels feel so much better than plastic ones. In fact, going back to a mouse with plastic wheels is like going back to your ex if you're still bitter with her (I won't recommend it).Accessories -It comes well packaged, and includes the pairing dongle, and a matching USB-C cable for charging. Thankfully, the charging port is to the front, so you can use the mouse while it's charging (looking at you Apple!).Speaking of charging, this thing charges incredibly quickly. I mean, three hrs of usage only after a few mins of charging is out of this world!Speaking of ""out of this world"", let's discussion functionality -On its own, the MX Master 3 is superb. But with Logitech's software, this thing is godly! The functionality and customizablility is second to none. If you have a specific idea of how you'd like to use this mouse with your PC and suit of programs, then almost anything is possible. You can even customize different functions for different programs, as well as have universal settings for general use. And speaking of ""godly""; that magscroll wheel is just that. They say you can scroll through 1000 lines of code in seconds, and that is no exaggeration. Scrolling normally puts you in ratchet mode (where you feel the ""click"", through every line), and with a quick swipe of the finger, it goes into ""smooth scrolling"", where it can literally scroll nonstop for about 10 to 12 seconds.I have this mouse (along with the MX Keys) paired with my laptop and I can easily switch between my desktop and laptop, without any cords or extra dingles. Literally, dragging my mouse cursor over to the laptop screen is all I have to do. I can have entertainment on one screen, and productivity on another. I'm even able to transfer files between the two systems, by simply copying from one system, dragging the cursor over to the other system and pasting. It really is that simple, though I rarely have a need for such functionality. But, it's there if I want it.PS - The knobs feel great and are positioned ideally for ergonomics.The only things that you may need to take into consideration are 1) It's for right-handed people only. And 2) If you're accustomed to very light mice, it may take you a while to get accustomed the added weight.",5-Feb-20

I have purchased some of Logitech's most expensive mice (including a wireless charging mouse pad), but they have these weird restrictions that their software places, that always pushes me back to using Roccat's offerings.For this mouse specifically, the available actions for the thumb / horizontal scroll wheel are different than the primary wheel. I wanted this mouse to swap the wheel actions (thumb wheel for vertical scrolling), to help with my overusing the same fingers, but this is not possible. Without this, this is just a heavy mouse with limited functionality to me. It is these types of limitations that make this mouse less ergonomic. Back to my Roccat.",4-Feb-20

1877,Heather,5,"Finally stopped waiting for it to go on sale and bit the bullet for $99.  Replaced an MX Revolution - had bought 3 of them used since production stopped in 2007.  This one seems to have fewer buttons, but the 'gestures' makes one button into several - for example set the scroll wheel to media gesture button and tapping will pause; holding the button while moving up/down/left/right will do volume and next/prev track.  Each button can be worth 5 buttons with gestures.  You can also set buttons to do different things in different apps (I didn't).  Ergonomics is comparable to the one I kept paying a lot to get used, maybe better...  Very pleased.",2-Feb-20

1882,"Trust me, I'm not a hipster",5,"I got an office job for the first time in 7 years, and the first purchase I made was the Apple Magic Mouse. It's a sleek design, and the touch control is nice, but it leads to a very sore hand at the end of the day.This mouse is very comfortable, especially for someone with large hands. I do miss the touch control of the Magic Mouse, but this mouse makes up for it with comfort, build quality, and customizability. I do some video editing, and having all of the buttons is incredible. I set the left thumb button to Undo, the right thumb button to Blade, the bottom thumb button to Zoom with Scroll, and the small center button to Keyframe. Definitely speeds up the editing process to have access to some frequently used functions.I use this on a plastic faux wood desk top with no mouse pad and have never had issues with tracking after 4+ weeks.The scroll wheel unlocking seems gimmicky, but I actually like it. Line mode gives accurate scrolling, and free mode is nice to get to the bottom of a web page or document etc. Though when automatically switching from free mode to line mode while the wheel is turning it makes a slight buzzing sound. Might be annoying to some, or not suitable for all situations, but this automatic switching feature can be disabled to prevent that from happening.PROS:Very comfortable.Incredibly customizable. Buttons can be changed per app.The free scrolling is quite nice.It feels very premium.Very accurate.CONS:The scroll wheel makes a buzzing sound when switching from free scroll to line scroll while the wheel is turning.I basically recommend this to everyone in all situations, and will likely buy another one.",31-Jan-20

1885,Mingding Wang,5,"OMG where do I begin. MX Master 3 is the best mouse you can buy right now, provided you're not a gamer. I don't game on my computer so I can't speak for gaming with this mouse, but as fas as getting work done and other day-to-day usage, this mouse is perfect.Compared to the last gen Master 2S, this mouse has significantly improved on the scrolling wheel, which is a ton smoother and doesn't make that loud clacking sound when scrolling under ratchet model. The new wheel is an absolute joy to use, massively improving upon an already advanced component. Also, the button placement on the side is a lot better too. The back and forward buttons are comfortably located instead of being cramped behind the side scroll wheel, making them a lot easier to access. I find myself using these buttons a lot more often than before. Oh did I mention there are more options in the software Options than before? The customizations to this mouse is practically unlimited - I have customized every single button and has implemented app-specific shortcuts on over a dozen apps. I am able to do pretty much everything a lot faster on this mouse than on any other mouse. Caution: once you're used to it, there's no going back.Ergo-wise, I like the feel of the Master 3 better than 2S. The mouse is thinner overall (looks like it lost some weight), making it more comfy to hold. The mouse surface is covered in a softer skin-like rubber layer, which is more comfy than the harder plastic-y finish on 2S. Tracking is pretty much the same, meaning it's gonna be enough for any regular user with any high-res monitors. Build quality also feels better than the 2S.Overall, this is just a fantastic mouse. It's solidly build, carefully designed, and well executed. It's not cheap; but if you decide to invest in a good productivity mouse to improve your workflow, then look no further.",29-Jan-20
1886,NewEnglander,3,"For being so super expensive mouse ($100), the magnetically controlled scroll wheel is buggy as hell. Knowing, that it's magnetically controlled and can be adjusted by software, itt still doesn't work right. I am trying to scroll 'UP', and many times the mouse doesn't sense I'm scrolling at all. If I go really slow, then it registers. Everything else works great, I just don't understand Logitech anymore. I really like how it feels and there is no issue with movement and speed, but the damn wheel is super annoying. I can't remember having such a bad experience, since the time when computer mice had a rolling ball and collected lint. I'm considering returning this mouse, it's unacceptable to have this sort of a problem on a $10 mouse, let alone $100. Magnetic or not.",29-Jan-20

I was really excited for this, so I'm pretty bummed that I'm returning the mouse.* Better, quieter scroll wheel.  They nailed it on this mouse.  Feels amazing, very similar to Microsoft's Surface Precision mouse.Cons:* Ergonomics, specifically:* Narrower, to the point that my ring and pinky fingers drag.  Unlike the 2S which felt great, this mouse is uncomfortably small for my hand.  This is the main reason I'm returning it.* Worse ""grip"" button.  On the 2S, you could apply pressure on the entire thumb pad.  With the 3, there's a small, somewhat awkwardly-placed divot that forces you to either grip the mouse uncomfortably or press the thumb pad with the side of your knuckle instead of your fingertip.I've ended up ordering a second 2S for work instead.  Bonus that it's cheaper due to being the older version, I guess, but that didn't factor into my decision at all.",29-Jan-20

This mouse paired with a great set of headphones, super speedy computer and some slight cheating on my part, keeps me winning and making him wonder what he is doing wrong.  :-)  I am happy with this mouse and would recommend it for any father wanting to keep his teenage son in his place.",20-Jan-20

1915,ArynBergman,5,"Been huge fan of the MX Master series for some time now and the 3 is an excellent upgrade to the 2S.  I use my mouse daily for engineering; mostly spreadsheets and BIM/CAD like work across 3x 32"" 4k monitors.  I'm brutal on my mice and keyboards.  Best changes are:- usb c finally- back and forward button are closer and easier to reach with the thumb; much better for mapping the middle button to- feels great; smooth with weight but not burdensome to move around.  Glides across the mouse pad- sized well for folks with fairly big hands- Can't notice any lag, but I don't use it for gamingMy biggest gripe with its predecessors has been durability.  The feet and battery usually wear out after a couple of years.  The feet can be replaced.  Finding a replacement battery with the correct voltage [in the U.S.] is a whole other story.  Will report back if the same happens with this one.",18-Jan-20

And the only solution is to reboot the computer. If I just turn the mouse on and off the mouse buttons are just back to their defaults. For my personal settings I have to restart the computer.Apart from this, however extremely irritating issue, I like the MX Master 3 a lot. Its precision. Form factor. Battery life. What I don't like, apart from the Issue, is:- the left scroll wheel, that it doesn't have the clicks for each step. Now it's way too sensitive.- that Firefox isn't fully supported in Logitech options- that Adobe Photoshop CS6 isn't supported at all in Logitech optionsOverall I like this mouse, but, since you can't use your personal settings in Logitech options you're as good with Anywhere MX or M705z no need to spend this amount of money.",15-Jan-20

1936,Y. Wang,5,"I've owned every MX master mouse since version 1. The MX master series are one of the best all-around productivity mice on the market. Ever since I started with version 1, I've been in love with them and keep buying the newest models. The upgrade from version 1 (MX Master) to version 2 (MX Master 2S) was rather minute and arguably not worth it. However this newest version seems to be redesigned with all of the weaknesses and criticism of the previous versions addressed.<br>The MX Master 2S simply added more (and better) color options to the original. The overall design and shape were practically the same except they removed a dedicated ""connect"" button on the bottom to a more streamlined and simpler design. Oh yeah, they also changed the logos, big whoop.The new MX Master 3 is a real redesign. The shape is different, the buttons are different, the materials used are different, and the size is overall smaller.The shape and design: The shape is overall wedge design. The look is less angular and more round. I personally had no issues with the previous design but the newest version is supposed to complement the new MX Keyboard, but I don't really see the similarities except for the grey/black color scheme (they're not even the same grey and black). The palm rest area is less wide which I will miss since it was way more comfortable and more natural. They also added these ribs all around the rear which helps with grip but grip was never really an issue. I think it was more of a visual aesthetic. Finally they removed the three LED battery charge indicators with just one solid LED light. This is yet again another simplification of design.The size: The overall size is smaller than the previous versions which isn't a good thing. I understand Logitech wants this to be a more portable mouse which the MX series never was. However I felt this was a mistake as it sacrifices the comfort. I don't have large hands by any measure. However even to me, this mouse seems less comfortable than the previous version. People with larger hands may opt for the 2s.Buttons: The buttons are the first good thing about this mouse. They are redesigned and for the better. The left and right click buttons now extend all the way past the edge which means no chance of hitting the solid (non-button) edge lip. Furthermore, because there is no lip, there's less gunk buildup on the lip edges which is a welcome change. Both scroll wheel ditch the rubber grips for a simple all-metal design. There is less tactile feel but tactile feel for the buttons was never an issue for me. The lack of rubber grip again means less dirt and grime getting stuck in them. They also removed the ""click"" spin of the wheel which is helpful. I was never a fan of the noisy spin of the wheel. The BIGGEST button change is the side thumb buttons. Logitech FINALLY moved the buttons lower and separated them. The previous two versions were uncomfortably placed next to the scroll wheel and it was near impossible to distinguish them by touch. It never worked for the MX Master, and it was unfathomable why they didn't elect to change it in the MX Master 2s. The buttons are WAY easier to press now and actually usable. The thumb scroll wheel is also larger which is again welcome.The battery is just as excellent as always. It takes weeks of use before I have to charge it and I hope Logitech never changes this!Of course the software and muti-device connections of the MX Master series is still here and still one of the best in the market. I can't stress this enough, I have a Desktop and two laptops. It's super easy to switch between different devices with a single push of the button on the bottom of the mouse. I went from having several mice for several devices to just a single MX Master and you never have to re-pair them once you've done it once. The new MX Keyboard now as this same functionality and it's definitely the best features Logitech devices have.The MX Master 3 is a great upgrade. If you're looking for one of the most versatile mice on the market this should be the top of your list. This is made for professionals - photographers (me), videographers, coders, designers, etc or just a power user with multiple devices that switch often. It really simplifies your life. The only thing it's NOT good for is gaming because the speed and sensitivity just isn't there. The redesign addresses a lot of standing issues with the MX Master series and improves upon them greatly. The only issues I can say is the smaller size and shape have compromised on the comfort of the mouse which was always a longstanding selling-point of the MX Master series. However this is not a deal-breaking change and it can be easily gotten used to.***If this review was useful for you, please give me a like! Thanks!***</br>",11-Jan-20

It feels great in the hand and even the cable that it ships with is very nice quality. It also comes in a box with no plastic &amp; instructions on how to remove the battery for recycling, which is a nice touch from Logitech.I write a lot of code and do video editing and the scroll wheel on this mouse has been insanely good. The magnetic scrolling on the main wheel feels great and helps me scroll through huge text files with ease. The horizontal scroll wheel is amazing for scrubbing through large timelines easily.I do some casual gaming on the side and the mouse feels great for that. It's probably a little bit heavy for competitive titles but as someone who only plays single player games non-competitively I don't mind. Overall a great mouse for productivity of all sorts and casual gaming!</br>",2-Jan-20

Paper, plastic, mouse pad or surface; this just works.The shape took a couple of days to adjust to, but I find that to be a common issue when switching mice after long term use.

1950,VN PH CIB TET,4,"WOW !! Logitech has done it again. This mouse is superb. The quiet and fluid action and the RESPONSIVE and ACCURATE horizontal scroll wheel - that's just really sweet. I have them all; from the Performance MX, the MX Master, the MX Anywhere 2S, the MX Anywhere 2 and even a few oldies like the M510. With the Performance MX one tilted the scroll wheel to scroll horizontal, basically like the MX Anywhere 2 /2S and even the M510. The MX Master went to a thumb scroll-wheel for horizontal scroll but it sorely lacked fluidity and accuracy. The Forward/Back page 'flippers' were too closely positioned to the thumb scroll to be intuitive. Now, the MX Master 3. Magnetically driven, silent, separation for the Forward/Back buttons from the thumb scroll wheel, accurate scrolling in the horizontal direction. I would always go back to one of my tilt-wheel mice as the tilt-wheel feature was more accurate that the thumb-scroll on the MX Master - but now, I just use the MX Master 3. Finally mastered - Thank you Logitech.",30-Dec-19

1956,Daniel Rimmelzwaan,5,"I got this mouse together with the MX Keys keyboard recently. The shape of the mouse is very personal, and I'm not sure if it will fit my hand in the long run. I've never had any carpal tunnel or RSI problems so I think I should be good. What I Love about this mouse is that it is a bit on the heavy side, so it feels very stable to me. The scroll wheel has this awesome capability where if you give it a good spin it almost feels like it disengages from the ratcheting and it scrolls like crazy. Then all you have to do is put your finger on it and it stops immediately. There is this side scroll button that is great for a variety of programmable things. For instance in Excel you can use it to scroll the sheet sideways, or writing a long line of code you can just pull the code editor page to the left.The USB-C charging cable plugs in where traditionally the mouse wire used to go, and you can charge it while using it and it feels natural. I just keep the charging cable plugged in on my desk and pull it out when the battery runs low.One of my pet peeves in Windows mouse is that you have to hack into the registry to change the scroll direction. Ever since I've used a MacBook for a few years, I've gotten to get used to and love the scrolling direction that is reverse from the standard Windows direction. The first thing that I do when I get a new mouse, is change the FlipFlopWheel attribute in the registry. When I did that for this mouse, it did not have an effect, which I did not like at all, until I found that the Logitech Options software actually has a setting for it!!! Amazing how such a little thing can make me THAT happy, but it does :)It's certainly an expensive mouse, but so far I'm happy that I spent the money. Hopefully it'll keep working well for a long time to come.",28-Dec-19

1960,David S,1,"I currently have a Logitech Performance MX mouse that I have used for nine years. Unfortunately, the scrolling mechanism is malfunctioning. I decided to buy the ""MX Master 3"" version thinking the physical form would be identical or very similar. Unfortunately, I have quickly found that this mouse -- for me -- is unusable. There is a steeper ""round off"" such that my ring finger and pinky are forced into an unnatural position. Within 5 minutes my hand began cramping noticeably.

1961,NBA Films,4,I like the design and feel in my hand so far. The scroll wheel isn't that amazing to me. It's better material over the previous versions but it's not neccesary. I still hear it rotating but it's a lot quieter. I've always had MX mice and didn't want to try out another company so I'm willing to suck it up! I like the idea of the side wheel. I'm hoping I will develop the habit of utilizing it on my editing timeline. It feels a little high for my thumb to naturally touch from its orginal position but it's not a deal breaker. My only complaint is that I usually have to replace my mouse after about a year or two of use. They always develop connectivity issues on my mac where my pointer would seem to disappear on me for a split second or would have extreme latency issues.

1964,Nick Naylor,5,"This review is comparing the Master 3 to the Master 2. I used the latter for the better part of a year and loved that mouse, but it was starting to get beat up and decided to ask for the 3 as a Christmas present. I haven't had a chance to put this mouse through its paces, but here are my initial impressions:- Connectivity is as easy as it was with the 2, and I have no issues with intermittent disconnection on Bluetooth. Logi Options makes setup a breeze, walks you through the functions of the mouse if you haven't used one before, and is actually a useful piece of software. The Master 3 functions essentially as a wired mouse, and I doubt anyone but the most intense gamers playing twitch shooters would notice any meaningful delays in movement.- Ergonomically, again nearly identical to the 2. For those that haven't used a MX Master mouse, it's extremely comfortable to use though does take a bit to get used to as it's a big ""bulkier"" than most mice. The feel is similar to holding a small, somewhat flattened baseball. I have no problem using this mouse for hours a day as a lot of my work is on the computer. There's no meaningful difference between the 2 and the 3, with the 3 just as comfortable as the 2. The 3 does seem to have a more rubberized texture on the body, which I personally like, but I anticipate that that will start to wear to some degree with heavy use.- I LOVE the gesture button, and that's what made me interested in the Master series to begin with. I use a Mac, so the gesture button allows me to replicate the important functions of the trackpad - e.g., quickly switching between desktops, bringing up Expose and Mission Control, etc. - on the mouse. The 3 is no different than the 2 in this regard. The gesture button does feel a little ""firmer,"" but that may be due to the fact that there's no wear on it at this point. If you're a Mac user and you're looking for something with a little more functionality than the Magic Mouse, this is the mouse for you.- I haven't had a chance to test connectivity on multiple devices yet. Assuming this is the same as the 2, this is a very nice feature that generally worked well, though I had occasional issues with my 2 on macOS seemingly not recognizing the device when switching between devices. This was fixable by simply forgetting the mouse and reconnecting it, which really wasn't that inconvenient since Logi Options remembered my settings.- The big difference between the 3 and the 2 is the mechanics of the scroll wheels. The scroll wheels on the 3 are MUCH superior, with a much quieter and smoother mechanism. This is a welcome change and is the primary difference that I've noticed between the two models thus far. The scroll wheel on the 2 would make a clearly audible clicking sound when used in ""ratchet"" mode, particularly when scrolled quickly, which doesn't happen with the 3.- Another difference is that, on the 3, the forward and back buttons on the side of the mouse, just below the horizontal scroll wheel, are laid out in a way that actually makes sense. These buttons were far too close together on the 2 - literally on top of each other - making it difficult to discriminate between them. On the 3, there's a very small amount of space which makes it easier to figure out which button you're pushing, and they're oriented front/back rather than right on top of each other.. This is another welcome change. See the attached image to see the difference (the Master 3 is on the left, the Master 2 on the right).If you currently have a perfectly functional Master 2, it probably isn't worth the cost to upgrade to 3 as the scroll wheel upgrade and changes layout of the forward/back buttons aren't, in my opinion, worth the $100 cost. However, if your old Master mouse is starting to kick the bucket or you just want to try the latest and greatest, the Master 3 is a very nice continuation of this great series of mice. Especially for Mac users, this is an excellent mouse as you can retain nearly all of the critical functionality of the trackpad with the generally easier use of a full mouse. Highly recommend!",26-Dec-19

The dongle doesn't work out of the box (worked once but not after paired) and Bluetooth connections can be finicky. Also the scroll wheel can also be finicky often jumping slightly. The tracking speed is too fast. On Windows this can be an issue on laptops because you can't have unique speed for the track pad and mouse meaning lots of setting tweaking if you need your track pad. I don't have this issue with any other mouse, that's very upsetting. I have noticed different surfaces effect sensitivity tho, I was able to more or less fix this concern with a surface change to an Ikea counter top desk setup.I do love how the scroll wheel feelsOverall aesthetic is good.Kinda heavy, but feels good in hand.

The scroll wheel is broken. There is no software fix as of yet.There are multiple occasions in which it just does not work. I'll be scrolling, works no problem, then out of nowhere it just stops. It's very noticeable and you'll be aware every single time it stops working. I've gone back and forth with my 2S which does not have this issue.Although everything about the mouse is great, I cannot be satisfied with a product that only works when it wants to.

1979,ThatGuyAgain,5,The last mouse I will ever buy. Amazing product.,16-Dec-19
1980,EMG,4,Very useful and helpful in switching between devices. My only alteration would be placing the switch to change devices somewhere on the top of the mouse so I would not have to pick it up to switch to another device.,16-Dec-19

1982,Korbin Bickel,5,"I had tried the original MX Master when it came out and didn't really care for it. The improvements since then make this my favorite mouse ever now. Works out of the box with Linux (even the thumb button is easy to map, registers as a keyboard button). Feels very sturdy and is comfortable. Great battery life and charges with USB-C.",15-Dec-19
1983,Aelferth,5,"I don’t know why it’s so hard to find a good mouse. I do a lot of programming at work so I am a heavy user and have, in the past, only had luck with a wired gaming mouse (e.g. Corsair). Many of the wireless mouses I’ve used, including Logitech, have been subpar, unreliable, and/or end up breaking with normal use. Knock on wood, this guy seems to be different. In fact it’s really nice. It fits beautifully in my hand, tracks well, and the scroll wheel... well I don’t know if I could ever go back to a plastic mechanically ratcheting scroll wheel again.I hesitated deciding to write this review because it is still unknown as to whether the thing holds up over time. To me, that is maybe the most important facet of a mouse at this price point. The mouse feels solid though and I’ll try and edit this review if it breaks under normal use.",14-Dec-19
1984,RicSCR,5,"So far another great addition to the mx family... somehow feels a bit smaller on the hand than both previous mx... Usb c charging is a good idea, way faster and convenient, side back /forward buttons and way more accessible. The only less impressive feature is the horizontal scrolling, feels way cheaper and lacks feedback in comparison with the vertical scroll that just got better and smoother. Worth the price? It depends on your needs and taste",14-Dec-19
1985,Kyle Thomson,4,"Overall this is a great mouse. I would definitely recommend. The only drawback of this mouse, is that it should have silent mouse clicks.",14-Dec-19
1986,Snave,3,"I like this mouse but the software is so buggy.After customizing the buttons, sometimes something happens with the Logitech Options software running in the background that nothing works the way it was configured.  All the Logitech processes have to be killed and restarted for it to work again.  It's the worst.Sometimes the buttons do double clicks or have delayed clicks after they're pressed.  In a browser, click the back button is like hitting the back button in the browser twice.  I set the thumb button to be the Enter key, yet sometimes when I click it, it opens up the virtual desktops in Windows.  Not even remotely close to the behavior of hitting the Enter key.  After double checking to see if the button configuration was reset, it still shows as configured for the Enter key behavior.When it works, it's great.  Just wish there wasn't a need for the Logitech Options software to be running in order for customized buttons to function the way they're configured.",13-Dec-19
1987,XytheX,5,"This is another Logitech design win. Sure it's a premium price, but if you're going to use something 9 hours a day, it might be worth investing a few bucks Into it.The weighting is nice, the accuracy spot on, and the thumb scroll is a life saver for navigating massive spreadsheets. The  thumb buttons have a little better placement over the original MX, and hopefully, the updated gesture button will hold up longer as that's what finally gave out on my original MX Master after years of daily use.",12-Dec-19
1988,RichardB,5,"I’ve used a lot of mouses (or mice as they call them). This has to be one of the better ones though I’m not surprised because Logitech has been a producer of good input devices for a long time. All the buttons and controls work as you would like, it’s very comfortable in the hand, easily programmable buttons. Just a good mouse overall, highly recommended. Oh and it doesn’t take up a lot of USB slots because I can share the transmitter between a Logitech keyboard and this mouse. The Logitech keyboard, the master MX is also awesome! Disclaimer: I’m a graphic designer not a gamer.",11-Dec-19
1989,Monsieur Rogiers,2,I purchased this mouse for a number of reasons.... but the deciding factor was the horizontal scroll wheel on the thumb.  Unfortunately this intermittently works 50% of the time.  Opening the logitech app will often get it working again but it's extremely frustrating and makes this mouse a nuisance more than a productivity enhancer.,10-Dec-19

1991,Adrian Radu,3,"I had 3 generations of MX Logitech mice and it's time for me to try something else.The good: nice looking, ergonomic shape, charged by USB C so future proof from this point of view, no need to keep buying batteries as it has internal battery, better placed and more rewarding buttons that the previous model (MX 2S)The bad: USB Dongle is not USB C (so if you have a new Laptop or will buy one in the future, you can only use Bluetooth.) There is no spot to store this dongle when travelling or not in use, this is a large mouse, there should have been a place for it somewhere. Although the scrolling has been improved, still needs a lot more calibration to feel predictable, smooth and well controlled.  I find my self going back to the Macbook pro touch pad to scroll for a better experience.",9-Dec-19

1995,nvr2amzd,1,"I was so excited to find the newest version of my beloved Performance MX mouse.  Unfortunately, this one did not function correctly.  It rarely accepted clicks (mainly for selection but also would not highlight selected areas) and it moved all over my screen when I tried to select an item/icon.  Horrid!  After a month of messing with this one, including manufacture tech support, software downloads and even fob changes (USB ports, too), I have given up and put this expensive, unsatisfactory mouse away, putting my older Performance MX mouse back into service.  Don't waste your money on this one!",8-Dec-19

1999,Leonard Washington,5,"***Update***It's been a few months now and I've taken my MX Master 3 back out of the drawer.I've been using it exclusively now, and don't remember the last time I wanted to switch back to the Performance MX.In short, it's grown on me. Here's why:• Very lightweight• I'm now apparently hooked on having a horizontal scroll wheel• OUTSTANDING battery life. I've only charged this because I get nervous about how eerily long it's been since the previous charge. I've easily gone over two months of daily usage without any charging.• Bluetooth connectivity. That basically upgrades my laptop by one USB port. That's huge.• I have a dual boot OS. This makes the device-pairing button very handy.***Update End; Original review follows***This is objectively a very good mouse.However I am honestly disappointed with my MX Master 3.The problem is that I owned a Logitech MX Revolution &amp; currently own multiple Performance MX mice.I absolutely love them, but they're are getting old and worn. So I decided to see what Logitech had to offer in their new models.I tried to like it, but after a week of exclusive use, I put it in a drawer and have gone back to my Performance MX.Pros:-Bluetooth connection capability is great. Freeing up a USB port by not requiring a receiver is a big plus.  Both the wireless receiver &amp; bluetooth connectivity has been responsive and solid in my experience.-The MX Master 3 is lighter than the Performance MX.-The ridged texture on the thumb rest/button is an improvement. You feel like you have more control with this enhancement.Cons:-The MX Master 3 is shorter lengthwise compared to the Performance MX. The shorter length doesn't support the bottom of my palm very well, causing my wrist to droop. This is also made worse by the taller height of the MX Master 3.-I had issues with the behavior of the scroll wheel on webpages. The free-spin worked fine, but the incremental setting seems coarse and abrupt compared to the Performance MX. The moment that I stopped using my MX Master 3 was when I got frustrated with the scrolling action while browsing the web.I had to keep switching to free-spin to get back to parts of the webpage that the incremental scroll wouldn't stop on.*****(This turned out to be a software issue, not the mouse. See update at bottom for)Overall, it really is a nice mouse, but apparently I've been spoiled.Maybe Logitech should consider creating a model that uses the superior form of the Performane MX and add some of more beneficial modern tech (e.g. Bluetooth, lighter &amp; longer-lasting battery)Until then, I will stick with the Performance MX as long as I can.",6-Dec-19
2000,Benedict,4,"First off, this mouse is amazing.  Having a side-scrolling wheel is great for large excel documents, or for a programmer, when that code starts drifting off the page a bit.Additionally, I didn't realize this mouse had a ratchet AND free-spinning scroll wheel for the main up/down scroller.  This is honestly the most amazing feature ever, the mouse scrolls with a detente just like any regular mouse, but if you have a large document you can flick it with some force and it will just spin for 10-15 seconds, and the spin is amazing.  Nice and silent.  The wheel has some weight to it which gives it some inertia.  I had fun spinning the wheel, then clicking into a window and automatically seeing the document start shooting down.  So fun!Now to the BAD!!!1) There is no slot for the RF dongle.  I use Bluetooth on my main computer, but I could still want to connect to a foreign computer when I'm in the field, and if there's no holder for that on the mouse itself, there's no way I can figure out some way to always have it on me.2) The side-scroll is a LITTLE forward for my hand, I would have liked if it was a little farther back.  I find myself having to re-position my hand and reach for it when I need to use it.3) My third finger (ring finger?) rests just to the right of the right clicker... and although the placement feels perfect and I can get ""underneath"" the mouse for easy re-positioning, I find that my finger lands on a sharp edge which makes my finger sore.4) The main scroller just broke an hour ago, I've been hoping that it will re-fix itself, but currently it will only free-spin and not ratchet.  That means that I'm constantly bumping it and making my window jump.****EDIT****My last point (reason #4) for giving this a 4-star review was because I thought my ratchet-scroll had broken and got jammed into freespin-only.  Turns out that the button on the mouse next to the scroll-wheel (which is usually used to change DPI) is actually an ON/OFF enable for the rachet/freespin mode.  I don't know why you would want to turn off such a nice feature ever... and really I think it's silly to have a button which toggles OFF such a great instrument, but for whatever reason, I missed the instructions which detailed this functionality and I must have hit the button by accident without realizing it.  Review changed back to 5-star but again, this mouses still isn't perfect (9 out of 10, or 4.5 star).For ERGONOMICS it gets a 3/5 because of the sharp ""edge"" that your third finger rests on.  Two weeks later, it is still making my ring finger sore where my finger meets the edge.  That is poor design if you ask me, all it takes is one day of testing to discover that it's uncomfortable.  Fix this and it's a 5/5.",6-Dec-19
2001,Jeff Wiers,5,A little different than previous model but after getting used to its great.,5-Dec-19
2002,Edgar Perez,4,"I am a first time adopter. I haven't owned the previous versions of this mouse so these are my initial thoughts.Pros: The scrolling is very satisfying. The ergonomics is also great. I come from ""designer"" mouses such as the Surface Arc and also the Apple Magic Mouse 2. These mouses began to give me wrist problems and it also tired out my fingers a lot. This mouse fits very well in my hands and I don't feel that it will give me any problems.There are reviewers who have said that there is jitter. I am running macOS Catalina 10.51.1 and have zero jitter. Also, there are reviewers who are concerned about input monitoring ""from your keyboard""; I'm fairly certain that macOS Catalina's improved security mechanisms are at play here. I believe that this needs to be enabled in the security settings because of the extra mouse buttons which can be registered as key strokes (such as the gesture button and wheel mode shift which can be modified). Some apps from Apple themselves warn with certain permissions as well.Cons: Like others, it's a bummer that the receiver is still not USB-C. It is especially inconvenient with modern MacBooks that need dongles to use USB 2 or 3. This led me to use bluetooth so at least it won't be that inconvenient.Another thing I noticed is that it is hard to rest my finger on the scrolling wheel; web pages move very subtly so I assume it is very sensitive, even in ratchet mode. Maybe my device is defective, so I'll exchange it to see if that's the issue.The other issue I have is that the only way to view the battery status is to use their application.",5-Dec-19
2003,James Ellsworth,5,"Crisp action in your palm.  The feel of quality materials and construction. Convenient USB recharging.  Upgraded software compared to my last model (Download it from Logitech.)  Long-lasting power, especially if the mouse is powered off when not in use.  Can be cable connected (supplied) to a USB port and charged while in use.I AM NOT A POWER USER anymore, so I fumbled a bit with the realization that my Logitech WAVE keyboard was not compatible with this mouse.  I purchased an MX Keyboard from Amazon and was back in business.  CONS:  Few of us really need a $100. mouse.  Few of us really need a $100. keyboard.  My idea of gaming online is Microsoft Solitaire Premium...so go figure.  My son has the memory and the dexterity to use multi-key commands in gaming.  I would need a dedicated game controller.",4-Dec-19

<span> BT and Logitech USB dongle, it would of been nice for a new mouse like this to use  USB C but I guess they figure there are two customers. Customers using the latest hardware will just connect via BT and those connecting to older type hardware would use the older USB A connection.This mouse is larger than the previous MX version. This mouse is more of a palm mouse rather than one you maneuver with your fingers. It does fit snug within your palm with easy reach to all shortcut buttons and scroll wheels. Mouse is very quiet and precision is spot on for a company that U would expect such quality.Matte grippy rubberized coating.Software is complete with allowing for customization of buttons and shortcuts.Convenient that it charges via USB C, wish  it had a dock to charge rather than having to plug in a cable each time to charge.Super useful that with this day in age everyone has multiple devices and this can be paired with up to three devices with an easy button press underneath.If you like palm mouses with extreme customization, smooth functionality and reliability then Logitech has brought it to the table.",4-Dec-19
2005,Carl Jenkins,5,"I really like this mouse. Before the MX Master 3 I was using the Logitech G305 which is also an amazing mouse.However, the comfort and ability to switch to different computers is absolutely worth every penny to me.Very pleased with this purchase.",3-Dec-19
2006,Lucas G,5,"I lost my MX Master 2, so I gave version 3 a try. It keeps all of the good features while improving some annoyances!- Having a separate row for the fwd/back keys is nice.

2008,Apollo's,5,It works as good or even better than the original MX mouse. My biggest complaint about the Original MX mouse was the short battery life since there was only one AA rechargeable battery in it. (They could have put at least 2 in their)Their lower end mice have 2 batteries and last for a long time) This mouse has lasted over 2 weeks so far..and we will see how much longer it will keep going.

Holmes,5,"While there have been some negative feedback on this product, I offered some of that negative feedback, I have since worked a bit with this product (it really didn't require all that much) and have found it to be a very good device after all.  Very often, some products take, for whatever reason, a bit of settling in time.  And sometimes the product isn't the problem, it is the user.  That was the problem in my case.

2016,S Kavi,4,"I have been using this mouse for two months now. I have been using different low to mid tier mouses in the past. I finally jumped on this MX train and it has been a good decision.Pros-Let's talk about the scroll wheel first. The ""infinity"" magspeed scroll on this mouse is AMAZING. I could scroll through pages of code smoothly in any code editor. However, there was a bit of a lag when browsing through web pages. I believe this might be because of my i5 processor as other applications handled it well.-The ergonomics on this mouse are just brilliant. The thumb buttons are exactly where they need to be and are fully customizable.Cons-The only one I can think of is build quality. I have paid a premium for this product. I wish Logitech would come up with better quality construction materials.",18-Nov-19
2017,Liam R,5,"Feels slightly lighter. Spins faster and smoother. The back and forward buttons are in more logical positions. I had to get this due to a few improvements, but also for the usb-c charging connector. I purchased the new MX Master Keyboard with usb-c a couple weeks ago. The MX keyboard has an advertised battery recharge cycle of 10 days. I have always kept my MX Master mouse plugged in all the time, so now, with both devices having usb-c charge receptacles, it's natural for me to put the charging cable back into the keyboard after topping of the mouse now and then.

2022,SL,5,"Since its predecessor (the Performance MX) was first introduced in 2010, the MX Master is the only mouse I buy. I use a mouse intensively for 8-10 hours a day at work and at least 2-3 hours a day at home almost daily, and I've bought over a dozen of these for my own use over the past decade. The mouse is well made, precise, and the free-spinning wheel is invaluable for some applications (the reason I bought it originally). The battery lasts me about a week of heavy use between charges, and it recharges fully from empty in a couple of hours. Downsides for some might be size (if you have small hands), weight (it's medium, not light), free-spinning scroll takes a little getting used to (but you don't have to use the feature), price (if you are budget conscious). Otherwise I would highly recommend the mouse to anyone who depends on a mouse to get their work done.",14-Nov-19
2023,geeyong Pak,5,Its nice fit for me,13-Nov-19
2024,Grant Fritchey,5,"At my home-office I've been using a trackball for a decade. It just feels better to me to have an immobile device to control the pointer on my computer. However, they're getting harder to find, and, frankly, not much new technology is being introduced through them. So, time to explore mouse options.Honestly, first one I tried and I'm absolutely in love. The MX Master is an excellent mouse. The ergonomic feel is very nice, especially the thumb rest and split between the ""grip"" area at your palm &amp; thumb, and the clicking surfaces under your fingers. It just feels nice. Yeah, I'm having to get used to moving my hand around again, but the responsiveness of this mouse is excellent. I suspect it'll make getting good screen captures easier (moving a pixel at a time required a very clean trackball).The button distribution and behavior is excellent. I like have a wheel, but I want it to be of the click variety, not that free movement. This one does both. Better still, it automatically switches depending on how fast you spin it, which is excellent. You can control this manually as well. The wheel also clicks, which is great for web browsing where I've long been used to opening new tabs using it. The introduction of a side-scroller is taking me some getting used to, but I'm digging it. I also like the context &amp; gesture button. I'm not sure I like the defaults of the gestures, all controllable and customizable. The other two buttons, also customizable add more functionality.Overall, this does way more than my trackball did (hence my interest in changing). I like the feel and the behavior of the buttons. The clicks are solid and satisfying, not squishy like some mice I've tried. I would say that this is a very good mouse and once I'm used to it, I'm going to be extremely happy with it. I'm already in love with the depth of functionality.",13-Nov-19
2025,Amazon Customer,1,"I got this mouse as a gift. I am a happy user of the first generation of the MX Master (almost 3 years) and very briefly used the second generation.The Mx Master 3 is a step back in ergonomics for me because the top of the mouse is not as ""flat"" on the previous models and that ""spike"" that is roughly between the thumb and the index finger is poking into the hand, making it uncomfortable.The button under the thumb is impossible to press, since it so much smaller. The original mouse has the button set such, that one can press it with the side of the thumb (the button as raised above the surrounding surface). The new model has the button surrounded by rigid edges under the soft cover, so that the button does not protrude (the button is recessed - that's fine for a button on a wall, but absolutely not for a button that is supposed to be pressed by the side of a thumb). My thumb essentially rests on the two edges of the button and I cannot just roll it and press it like I can on the MX Master 1. (See photo).Generally, the mouse is not as comfortable. The thumb wheel is not close to the thumb, so the thumb needs to move up about 1 cm to even touch the side scroll.The ""freespin"" does not spin as long as it does on the first generation. It is noticeably slower, therefore it stops earlier. It does not feel even a little bit more precise or faster as advertised.While it is quieter, the scroll is mushy, does not react to fast movements.If anyone is looking into getting a mouse from the Master series, you'd be better off buying the previous models, especially since they are much cheaper now that the third model is out.",13-Nov-19
2026,Mr. Skeptical,5,"I have been using logitech since mx darkfield. Although the general outline was kept the design get improved greatly. Compared to previous versions, MX Master 3 fits in my hand very well and I can use it quite a long time. Personally, I loved the side buttons and scroll. So far this design is superior among the other Logitech MX series.I feel the clicker sound is a little softer and it doesn't make too much noise like the previous ones. I mainly used this at work, especially for 3D modeling. I also used it a couple of times at home for gaming. It is compatible with many games including FPS games like counterstrike or games like Witcher.Since I only have a windows system, I do not know how it would work on a mac. I recommend this mouse.",13-Nov-19

2031,Peter S.,5,"I'm a fanatic for control by mouse.  I've used Logitech mice with this kind of scroll wheel for years.  This mouse ups the game with better ergonomics (still could be better - as could most mice).  Many configuration options.  I use the side scroll wheel (default is horizontal scroll) as zoom in and out, press the scroll wheel to minimize the current window, buttons for back and for closing current tab or window.  And four gesture commands available (I have refresh, scroll to top,,,).  The wheel action is the best yet.  I have app specific commands for outlook, firefox, etc.<br>Still positive is that I move a laptop between home and office and have one of these mice at each location and each with it's own usb receiver in a docking station.  I can move between seamlessly.  The old logitech system one had to run logitech connect whenever the location was switched.I also have an MX Anywhere 2S for travel that is included in the LogiOptions configuration software.The only negative is that LogiOptions sometimes has to be run on startup to get custom configuration loaded.  Tried to have LogiOptions run on startup, but it won't for some reason.  So, I have a hotkey to run it when needed.  Minor inconvenience.Overall, highly recommended.</br>",10-Nov-19

2033,Onselm Adams,1,I did not like this mouse at all and it was returned the day I got it. The thumb section feels horrible as the two cheap mushy buttons jam into your thumb in standard holding position. This alone made it absolutely useless to me. I cannot believe (according to other reviews) that other users can actually tolerate this incredibly annoying shortcoming.,10-Nov-19
2034,mike sori,5,"this mouse is 100% sick , everything is the best cept for 2 minor downs:the 4th and 5th buttons could be better , yet still pretty goodand the software for linux flow...if anyone knows of the flow software for linux plzzzzz lmk necromancer011@yahoo.comvery very good mouse",10-Nov-19

2036,SJWalt,5,"Using on a Windows 10 Lenovo desktop.  I'm not a gamer, just email, surfing, Office stuff, etc.  Love this mouse.  Easy to install, feels solid and responsive.  Happy with Logitech products, a bit more expensive, but reliable, well-thought out and worth the extra cost.",8-Nov-19
2037,N. Grove,5,"The latest of many Logitech mice I've used over the years, and my favorite to date.  I particularly like: the center scroll wheel options, the thumb wheel (although I don't need to use it all that often) and its application by application programmability.  It's also got a nice smooth glide, no doubt benefiting from how light it is.  I've had it for many weeks now, and only needed to plug it in for recharging once.  Having said that, I do make a point of turning it off when I'm not using it.",7-Nov-19
2038,S. Holloway,5,"After using the MX Master for a long time then upgrading to the MX Master 2, I was hoping the 3 would go back to the focus on ergonomics of the palm grip... so glad it's back! The curve to the thumb is much more aligned to how I hold the mouse, the scroll wheel is surprisingly better than the amazing MX 2, and it feels much lighter in weight yet is heavy enough to move accurately and not feel cheap. The higher pitched clicking noise is different, but it gets tuned out very quickly. Solid mouse in the line and highly recommended!",7-Nov-19
2039,Peter II,2,"Note: This review compares the Logitech Performance MX to the MX Master 3 (I have not used the models in-between).  I purchased the mouse from an online Amazon competitor and will be returning it (apparently at my expense -I should have purchased it from Amazon)I really wanted to like this mouse, but three things made it a non-starter for me.1. I don't use and don't like the scroll wheel on the thumb-side of the mouse.  It is placed where the forward and back buttons used to be (Those have been moved lower and are now awkward to push with my thumb).2. The pad placement at the bottom of the mouse (with a longer one located beneath the thumb), creates a weird sideways drag as I move the mouse.  As I move it around my desk, I feel like I'm fighting with the mouse to keep it straight.3. The laser doesn't track as well as the Logitech Performance MX mouse does on my glass desk, causing it to skip fairly frequently.  I've never had that happen with the standard MX mouse.",6-Nov-19

2043,Matt Knoff,5,So far I've used this mouse for a month and have had no issues with it at all. It seamlessly moves from my PC to my Macbook without any issues. Battery life is great so far and the overall feel of the mouse is just right for my hands. Great overall.,6-Nov-19
2044,Amazon Customer,1,"this is my first time buying mx master series mouse. like other people, my mouse scroll wheel has delay/no response issue. i am very disappointed of it",4-Nov-19
2045,DL,4,"This mouse was advertised as perfect for architects and engineers, neither of which I am. Setup was easy; just plug in the USB receiver, switch the mouse on, and go.<br>My current wired mouse has left- and right-click buttons and an up-down scroll wheel. This mouse has a few more buttons that will take some practice using. There's the left-right scroll wheel. Underneath this wheel are two page navigation buttons: the front one is for going forward one page, the back one is for going back one page. There are a couple of other buttons that I don't think I'll ever use.This mouse is taller than I'm used to, so it's awkward for me to hold. The buttons aren't so easy to reach. Several reviewers mentioned that this mouse isn't for people with small hands, but I have large hands for a woman. Maybe it will get easier to use with time.</br>",3-Nov-19
2046,Leisan,4,"I've been using a performance MX mouse at work and home for 5-6 years now.I recently upgraded to this mouse...Cons: The clicks on this mouse are louder than I expected. The scroll wheel will auto ""infinity scroll"" if you scroll too quickly. The power button (on the bottom) is no longer located in a position that allows for one hand support.Pros:It's super light! Love the usbc. Gray looks better than black. The additional scroll wheel on the thumb is appreciated, way better than a left right rocker on the MMB. The improved multitask thumbbutton is also appreciated, looks less flimsy.Unsure:The forward &amp; back buttons may be a bit too small, but I'm at only 15 hours of use on the mouse.Overall great mouse, complaints are tiny and overshadowed by the rest of my experience with the mouse",3-Nov-19

2048,Samantha,5,I must tell ya'll... I am loving this mouse! I spend a lot of time on the computer. Between being a full-time data analyst and then graduate school... I literally use the computer everyday. I have gone through numerous mice and because I have a laptop I will just stop using them because I find that many are not comfortable to use for long periods of time.This one deserves a gold crown. First - it fits my hand perfectly. I do have pretty small hands so I can't speak for everybody.The response time is crazy fast. The scroll wheel is super sharp. It looks good and it feels good. I also am shook that you can pair it to multiple devices at the same time. This is perfect for me since my computer for school is a PC but my work computer is a MacBook.,1-Nov-19
2049,MS,5,"I was using the Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic keyboard and mouse for my office setup for the laptop. I had used earlier versions of Microsoft ergonomic keyboard for years and was happy. But this time, with the sculpt, I started getting issues within a year - keyboard missing characters and mouse being slow and erratic (even after replacing batteries). I got this mouse for review more than a month ago.All I can say is Wow. Excellent response for mouse movements. The middle button works well for me for Linux cut and paste operations as well. So easy to hold with your hand but this is for right handed use and might be a challenge/adjustment for left hand use.Battery life - don't know and have to wait for few more months, so far so good.Plug and play install and didn't need to do anything other than installing battery and plugging in the USB dongle on Windows 10 Professional laptop.Highly recommended for serious computer users - for both coding soldiers and powerpoint warriors..",1-Nov-19

<span> Didn't buy on Amazon, but figured this info is most appropriate here. The scroll wheel jiggles back and forth on its own slightly after scrolling in ratchet mode almost every time if you gently flick it enough to get some momentum, but not enough to engage smooth scrolling..or if you simply power the mouse down in ratchet mode and scroll with any force at all. It doesn't move enough to register a scroll, but enough to provide additional tactile feedback that FEELS like more ratchets of the wheel, so the feedback on-screen is not consistent with the tactile feedback coming from the mouse. I've used previous MX Master mice with the previous gen scroll wheel, and they do not behave similarly at all. If you watch reviews of the V3 with close up shots of the reviewer interacting with the scroll wheel, you can see it in review videos too. It feels like the mouse is still scrolling, but it's really just.....kind of vibrating. Love everything else about the mouse, but this is infuriating, and NOBODY seems to be talking about it. I do not believe it is possible to patch in software, as it is reproducible with the mouse powered down in ratchet mode. It really just makes the mouse seem unpolished like a not quite finished piece of tech, and I would not expect this sort of unfinished/unrefined feel on a $100 mouse.EDIT: Attaching a slow-mo video that shows exactly what I'm talking about",31-Oct-19
2051,BM,2,The size of the forward/back buttons by the just below the horizontal scroll button are way to small. They are like slivers so its hard to use your thumb to go forward/backward. The side button could sure be  alot bigger.,29-Oct-19
2052,Sherzodbek Juraboev,5,"Thanks! Finally, you did it right with the usb-c charging port!!! Please, remove the ancient and inconvenient micro-usb port from all of your peripherals. I am waiting for all the gaming mice to go USB-C! I no longer have to carry an extra cable for my mouse!",28-Oct-19
2053,QD,2,"The only improvement for this mouse compared to MX 2s is the horizontal scroll wheel, which is bigger and positioned better. Everything else is a downgrade from MX 2s. The material is less comfortable. If you use Macbook Pro, the vertical scroll does not behave correctly. This is both hardware and software bugs with the new vertical wheel. Very disappointed. Consider MX 2s or Triathlon instead.",26-Oct-19
2054,James R Jatho,5,"I've had many, many of the high end Logitech mice throughout the years, and I can definitely say this is the nicest one yet. Ergonomically it's fantastic, and although all the other Logitechs I've had were great as far as build quality, but this one feels like a step up. Everything just feels so smooth and precise.

2055,Rebecca Suraci,5,LOVE IT!,25-Oct-19
2056,Doc,5,"Amazing. Hands down THE BEST mouse I have EVER used. I am not a gamer so I cannot really speak to that, but the mouse is responsive and a pleasure to use. The gestures are a game changer and the scroll-wheel is addicting (I know that sounds absurd, but you have to just use it to see what I'm on about here).The unit is rechargeable via provided usb cable and even a single minute of charge gives you hours of workability. I got this in combination with the MX keys and could not be happier.",24-Oct-19
2057,Soar,5,"The wheel is fixed.  Last year, when my old Logitech Performance MX mouse gave up the ghost I purchased the Logitech MX Master 2S mouse and found the mouse wheel on it unusable, it would rock back and forth when letting go over it moving the web page or spreadsheet or word doc.. making using the mouse infuriating.  I thought it was defective only to learn (many phone calls, exchanged products) that it was a ‘feature’.  No thanks.When I received the MX Master 3 I was flooded with relief when I started using it and the smooth scrolling wheel (that did not move when let go of) was back.  I love this mouse.Installation.The Logitech Options app had a lot of problems when setting up the MX Master 3 mouse.  The screen would black out and lock up and starting about 10% of the time.  When trying to apply application specific profiles the application locked up.  I finally just got the basics set and left the application alone.Usage.I find the mouse wheel on the MX Master 3 to be one of the most useful and smooth of any mouse I’ve used.  Out of the box the mouse sensitivity was way off and had to muck about with the Logitech Options app to get that set to my satisfaction.The forward and back buttons by the thumb are just not right yet.  They feel too small and in the wrong location, like they should be further forward.  My thumb seems to always rest on the forward and I would prefer it rest on the back or in the middle, but the mouse button layout is not designed out for that to be natural.  I find the thumb wheel to be really useful when I remember it exists.  Like switching tabs with it in a web browser.I have large hands.  The mouse feels different than my old Performance MX mouse (even though they look the same) but still feels comfortable for me.Overall exceedingly pleased with the MX Master 3 mouse.",23-Oct-19
2058,Natorae Wettstein,5,"I heavily use the following software:- Revit- Autocad- Bluebeam- ExcelFunctionality:This mouse is by and large the best mouse I have every owned, there are tons of preset options that you can set for the buttons or scroll wheels and if there is not an option listed that you would like you can enter in a keystroke as the function for one of the buttons or scrollers. The scrollers can do more than just move up dwn lft rght or zoom, they can toggle between bluebeam documents, tabs in the browser, views in revit as well as other functions. The support software for the mouse is EXTREMELY responsible and reliable which I love, as soon as you change a setting it is changed there is no latency at all. The 'hyper scroll' feature can be turned off or toned down to whatever sensitivity that you prefer which is nice.By far the best part about the mouse is that you can set different profiles for any program. All programs default to whatever your global setting is but you can set a local setting for everything from scrolling sensitivity to button functionality depending on what program you are using. They have a few programs listed like excel and photoshop or something listed on the website or description as options for making unique profiles but you can set any program to have its own profile. Sort of weird that they would make it feel somewhat exclusive which made me apprehensive when looking to get this mouse.I did not purchase this mouse off of amazon, my company purchased this mouse for me.(in case it lists me as an unverified purchase that is why)",21-Oct-19
2059,Ben Schoon,5,I've been a proud owner of every MX Master mouse and the 3 just makes everything better. I especially love that it finally charges over USB-C just like everything else on my desk and the new scroll wheel is *really* nice too.,20-Oct-19
2060,Ken,5,"I bought the entire MX setup and the mouse is easily the stand out winner. Best mouse I’ve ever used. Silky smooth action with gestures. Perfectly tactile buttons that have a satisfying click. Smooth, accurate scrolling at all speeds. Easy to use secondary buttons. Most importantly, the ergonomics makes clicking all day a breeze. I deal with wrist pain from years of using awful input devices. After using this device I can honestly say it’s taken away my wrist shoulder and neck pain. I also do not get a twinge of pain with every click and scroll like I do with lesser mice.",19-Oct-19
2061,starfox6477,2,"Logitech decided to make this mouse narrower and taller than the Mx Master 2S.

It's all in the marketing.",17-Oct-19

Since I have several, I love the fact that the mouse can easily connect via bluetooth to each of them without having to reconfigure anything. I also love the ergonomics, and the solid feel the mouse gives you when you operate it. Speaking of it, the mouse works great and it's extremely smooth on every surface. One more thing: I have big hands, and the mouse size is perfect for me. I say that because someone with small hands might find the mouse a little big. Try it before committing to it.All in all, a great product worth the cost.",14-Oct-19
2065,Theologos Sosonis,4,One more excellent revision of the MX Master series.,14-Oct-19
2066,Techtesting,4,"Very comfy.  I love the scroll wheels.  However, the left thumb button where you are supposed to be able to push 4 ways for 4 different commands doesn't work right.  It's fairly useless.Great tracking.  Again, another but.  BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO SWITCH DPI on this thing with its 14+ buttons.  Why?The Logitech software is meh.  And to be honest I hate proprietary software as it usually just usually memory for no reason and crashes a lot.",14-Oct-19
2067,Rob,2,"I've always loved the MX series. The aesthetic and ergonomic design is top notch. The software works as intended. The best part is the scroll wheel... Unfortunately, it's wireless capabilities suck. The Bluetooth and RF USB adapter both have an incredibly short range. Anything solid in the way like a desk, your laptop's frame, a stone coaster or glass... they all interfere with the connection even when the receiver is less than a meter away. furthermore there is noticeable lag and jitter when playing video games. To be honest, a designer in Photoshop would notice it too. It's tracking accuracy is sporadic to say the least a downright disappointing overall. Mice like the Razer Mamba or Corsair Dark Core, while marketed for ""gaming,"" have superior wireless technology inside them. It's a real shame that Logitech puts ten year old wireless technology inside their top of the line mouse. It makes no sense.On top of all that, there's no dock or Qi charging. I have to keep a dedicated cable at my desk for this mouse to charge. Not a big deal on it's own, but even when plugged in it still relies on wireless for it's connection to the computer.Overall, Logitech made a good looking and feeling mouse, but put bad tech inside of it for the part that matters most. I would not recommend this mouse unless all you plan to do with it is brows the web. even then you'll notice the poor connection.",13-Oct-19
2068,Xephz82,5,"This mouse is pretty nice. One thing I like about it is that it give you the option of having both a USB plug as well as Bluetooth connectivity. There is no slot on the mouse to hold the USB plug unfortunately. This mouse is a big upgrade from past Logitech mouses as it use a type c plug to charge. The type c cable is not extremely long as it feels meant for being charged with a laptop. This usual makes for faster charging as there is a built in battery inside the mouse.  The mouse battery can last several weeks before needing to be recharged and will auto sleep if it is not active or not connected. The mouse does have a pretty good feel. It does not hurt my wrist or anything while I am using it. The mouse scrolling wheel is pretty nice and accurate. You can scroll down at fast speeds or you can get precision scrolling. The material of the mouse is smooth but provides grip so you do not slide off the mouse. It is a fairly big mouse but you can take it on the go if needed. The USB dongle is pretty small so you can take it on the go but be careful not to lose it. If you want to not have to worry about the dongle you have the option of Bluetooth which in my opinion is a lot better in terms of connectivity. You get more range with this mouse on Bluetooth then you do with dongle. It is a pretty easy setup and with all the new laptops having standard Bluetooth, this mouse works perfectly. You can get about fifteen feet away from the computer/laptop before you start noticing any lag. The response time on the mouse is accurate. You do not have any lag time with this mouse on USB or Bluetooth. The mouse has a pretty sensitive DPI making it decent for gaming as well if need be. I would not say it is the best for gaming as I am not a fan for wireless mouses being used for gaming. You can adjust the DPI on the mouse. Overall I think this mouse is a good investment if you are looking for a decent gaming mouse while also having a good mouse for working on things like financing and powerpoints.",13-Oct-19
2069,Amazon Customer,2,"The Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse - Graphite is a well constructed mouse, but the most important feature of the Options Software is not present (there is no pointer acceleration setting).  The only way to get accurate pointer motion is to lower the pointer speed, but this will result in having to move the mouse 6 inches left or right for a dual monitor setup.  Also the Options Software disables SetPoint which has an acceleration setting.",12-Oct-19
2070,Derek,4,"Logitech’s MX Master line of mice has become a gold standard for office mice. This year’s edition of the series brings improvements, albeit iterative, over the previous generation. The MX Master 3 is responsive and precise enough to negotiate sophisticated business and creative tasks even when placed on glass desktops. Unfortunately, gamers that are into high FPS shooter genres still may not get the responsiveness they desire from the MX Master 3.There’s a ton to like about this mouse starting with the ergonomics. If you’re right-handed (sorry fellow lefties) this mouse was designed to provide a rich feature-set at your fingertips. The revamped electromagnetic scroll wheel might be the most lauded feature due to the stunning silence with which it operates. There are also gesture controls, a second scroll wheel and and dedicated forward and back buttons nestled within thumb’s reach.Connectivity and battery life are amazing on the MX Master 3. The MX Master 3 can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux. There are even edge controls where dragging and dropping files from on synced, open systems is as simple as dragging the mouse to the corner of the screen. Then there’s the issue of battery life. I charged this mouse once (and gladly did so via USB-C) and it’s run strong on 3 different systems for over a month. Logitech claims a 70-day battery life and they may not have been exaggerating. I wish I could tell for sure how much battery life is remaining, but there are no battery indicators so far as I can tell.Pros:- Beautifully designed mouse with a robust feature-set and cross-OS useability- Superb battery life. Day 33 and this mouse is still going strong. I also appreciate having USB-C charging. Manufacturers need to universally adopt USB-C as the standard for charging and syncing devices today.- Works on all types of surfaces from wood to glass with no issues.- Can connect via Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz adapter; useful for devices that may not have Bluetooth built-inCons:- Not designed for lefties. As a southpaw, I was bothered that this mouse makes no pretenses about being designed exclusively for right-handed customers. We lefties have to adapt to something that isn’t made for us.- Could be related to my being a lefty trying to adjust to a right-handed mouse but I kept inadvertently clicking the forward and back buttons on this mouse. Seems innocent, but if you’re typing a document within a web browser that content can/will be lost.- High FPS gamers may be left out in the cold with this mouse. At this price point, Logitech shouldn’t exclude any demographic who’d want to use their product.Overall, I think this is the finest general purpose mouse on the market. Users can go from business and productivity work to creative designs without issue. This mouse even works on multiple OS’s with quick access to file transfers for open systems even if they’re not using the same operating system. Lefties and gamers may lose some comfort and convenience, but I think all but the most ardent within these sub-groups will find a way to be perfectly satisfied with the MX Master 3 Mouse. Highly recommended to most users.",11-Oct-19
2071,Ryan,2,Scroll wheel does not detect scrolls for roughly a second immediately after lifting the mouse or placing it down. sent this to support but all they could do is send a replacement mouse which had the same issue. Don’t get this mouse if you plan to use it for a bit of a gaming along side productivity.,11-Oct-19
2072,Ryan H.,5,"All of my previous mouse' have been between $15 and $30. So buying a $100 mouse was quite a gift to myself. I decided, one, if I didn't like it, I can return it. And if it encouraged me be more productive, then it's worth every penny.It was super easy to pair. And it has stayed connected to my two devices with ease. The bottom of the mouse has a button, you press once to move to one of three allowed devices. Hold it to pair between the three.You need to download the Logitech Options app from the Logitech website to change button functionality. Most options are available there from using the side wheel to change computer volume, to opening website tabs using specific buttons. There are 7 clickable buttons including the top scroll wheel. The side wheel does not click in as a button.The scroll wheel on the top can either scroll with small notches or completely smooth. This can be varied by the middle top button by default. I like the small notches. If you scroll on the wheel too quickly though, it will automatically spin smooth until you stop it. I just wish websites and other items that scroll can handle how fast the wheel can. I find it gets stuck as it loads.Most applications are represented in the Logitech Options program. And you can program each mouse button to operate a different function in each app. From Photoshop, to Final Cut Pro, to Google Chrome. Each button on my mouse functions a different item in each program. Final Cut the side wheel scrolls the timeline, while the top button deletes a clip. In Google Chrome, the side scroll operates volume and top button opens a new tab. This function has easily found it's way into my daily tasks. Not sure I would know how to use a normal mouse now...The mouse is larger than my previous ones, I'm hoping it will travel okay. It does fit my medium sized hands better than the travel version MX Anywhere.The Flow function (which allows the mouse to slide onto another computer that's next to each other) was a little hard to set up and I found it to be a little laggy. It seems like I'm better off just clicking the bottom button to switch between my iMac and Macbook Pro. I was also a little concerned that the mouse was bluetooth and that it would be laggy when editing on Final Cut or Photoshop - which hasn't been the case at all. Very smooth. I did however use the dongle to see if that would potentially be even better, but I found it lagged more with the dongle, maybe due to both bluetooth and dongle being on. I plan to just leave it on bluetooth if possible.I've had the mouse for three weeks and only charged it when I first got it. I edit on final cut from home so it gets a lot of use.Overall, I'm extremely happy with it. It is a lot a more clicky than I would choose, but definitely a small problem in the scope of how great this mouse is. For the list people, I'll list my pros and cons if you didn't read the rest.Pros:Programmable buttonsAmazing battery lifeEase of connectionErgonomic and fits the hand wellLooks attractiveYou can load the programmed buttons to your other paired device to keep with consistency between devicesCons:It's a bit expensive for a normal mouse (worth the price)Clicky right/left buttonsA bit on the bigger side, but thats more preference/travel issueNo dongle store slot in the bottomA hair on the heavy sideAll in all, an exceptional mouse in its class that has no rivals. Best mouse I've used. Worth the money. If you use a mouse daily/hourly/minutely, this is worth the look.Bonus Review: MX Keys4 out of 5I also bought the MX Keys with it. Great keyboard. A little on the ordinary side for $100.Too heavy and large to travel with, so will be in my home office.Backlit keys are nice, but wish light didn't bleed out around the corners of the keys/but this seems normal. Can easily pair between three devices. The only buttons programmable are the f buttons at the top that already control major computer items. I wish more buttons were programmable like the number keys on the side.I do like having the numbers on the side which I thought I wouldn't. However, it would be nice in photoshop to change those buttons to control brushes, etc.Not sure about battery life, I've only used the keyboard for about a week, but haven't had to charge yet. I'm on my computer hourly.Pros:Heavy, solid keyboard with nice travel on keysNice slant (however it cannot be changed to fit your needs)Backlit keysSnapshot and calculator buttonsProgrammable f buttonsAttractive with the MX Master 3Cons:A tad expensiveA hair too long due to the number keys, but not unmanageableOnly top row of buttons are programmableMX Keys is a solid, well crafted keyboard that pairs great with the MX Master 3. The coloring is attractive and its low profile along with offering nice travel for the keys and comfort with the key grooves is a huge plus. I spent about $200 on it, but found a coupon code for 10% off LOGITECHSAVE10 when buying at Logitech.Both are worth buying. Both are amazing products and I know that if you spend the money, you won't regret it.",10-Oct-19
2073,Surya Teja Veeravalli,5,This mouse is wonderful. Cant ask for more. Very good for productivity. We can do application specific gestures using the mouse.,8-Oct-19
2074,Richard N. Barg,3,"There is no question the placement of the back and forward buttons has been improved as well as the horizontal scrolling wheel. The tracking also seems more precise. The gesture button is also vastly improved and now has an actual physical button.  Before there was nothing.However, the deal breaker for me is the shape of the mouse.  On the MX Master, I can rest my 2nd and 3rd fingers on the mouse buttons, which have a glossy finish. There is very little effort involved in clicking the buttons.  The MX3 has a lower profile than the MX Master. The shape has been radically changed. On the MX3 there is a gap between where my fingers sit and the mouse buttons. My fingers no longer rest on the mouse buttons.  The  physical mouse buttons on the MX Master, besides sitting higher, are about 5/8"" cm longer in length and that also makes a perceptible difference. The MX buttons are also a bit wider, which makes them easier to press.  Essentially, it's more fatiguing to my 2nd and 3rd fingers to hold them just above the buttons on the MX3. The surface of the MX3 mouse buttons is also matte which creates a bit more friction. The angle of the buttons is also different. The bottom line is that MX3, while sleeker and more polished in design,  is much less comfortable (to me) and requires more effort and dexterity to use. Those with different size hands might find their results are different from mine. I'm also 67 and might not have the same dexterity and strength as a younger person. The ergonomics are just not there for me.",7-Oct-19
2075,M Higgins,4,"It's excellent in all its features, it's a bit pricey but if it lasts, I won't have buyer's remorse.I would have rather had a replacement for my G700s but this is growing on me. The battery is by far better than the G700s and I'm getting used to the button arrangement. I used the tilt scroll wheel to scroll horizontally on the G700s but I'm finding the side scroll on the MX3 is just as good. The scroll wheel itself is faster and smoother which is another plus. There was more programmability for each button on the G700s and I'm hoping that's going to improve in the software for the MX3",7-Oct-19
2076,Crystal F.,5,"This mouse is the best one I have used so far.  Very superficial for the wrist. Electromagnetic scroll wheel allows for precise or freewheeling motion. Downloadable profiles for popular apps. Works across up to three devices, and even between OSs. Great battery life.",7-Oct-19
2077,Edward Kobylack,5,The MX 3 mouse by Logitech looks and works great!  As with MX Keys keyboard the link printed on box to acquire needed drivers is inaccurate and you need to search on web for the correct link.  Battery life is superior!  Works on any surface I’ve tried.  Very comfortable for larger hands with long fingers.,5-Oct-19
2078,Carol,5,"I ordered this for my husband, an electrical engineer who designs stuff at work using two computers at a time. Oddly, he never even took it to work. He tried it out at home and decreed it ""bulky"" and heavy. I've commandeered this mouse, which is capable of so much more than I'll ever be capable of, myself, which makes me feel guilty for failing to utilize such a nice bit of tech. Then I remember how little I have ever utilized my computer, phone, even my Kindle, which can do so many things I've never tried to get it do. So, this wireless mouse (rechargable; no batteries; no long cord tangled at the side of my pc) is like a Jaguar that I drive as if it were a1978 Oldsmobile. Ah, the wasted opportunities. But it's a nice, smooth ride, and I like it.",2-Oct-19
2079,Amazon Customer,1,"I ordered on Sept 10th, didn't arrive until Sept 30th, annoying but it happens. I try to turn it on and nothing happens. Maybe it needs to charge so I plug it in and wait. Still nothing after messing with it over the days, DOA. Now I have to ship it back which is a massive pain. The replacement won't ship until November! I want to like this mouse and it feels nice in the hand but this situation sucks.",2-Oct-19
2080,eric,5,"I've been mostly using gaming mice the last several years, even for normal work and Logitech is currently my favorite brand for lightweight, quality, and reliability. I've heard so many great things about the MX Master mouse and was curious to try it. I will say right off the bat that I was and am very impressed with this mouse. It is comfortable to use, extremely accurate, works on any surface including a glass desk, and the battery lasts about a month before needing a charge. Those features are great but the main thing that keeps me using this mouse over my other ones is the scroll wheel and the gesture feature which is programmable. The side scroll wheel is also very high quality and can be programmed on a per application basis which is just fantastic.For users of the previous MX Master, this has a lot of similar features but the most noticeable to me are the side buttons, which are laid out more like a traditional gaming mouse and not crammed on top of each other like the previous models. I actually tried using this for gaming and aside from being a bit heavy, it works very well. I wouldn't recommend this primarily as a gaming mouse but for someone who plays occasionally, this one works fine and there's no need to buy a separate mouse, although I would recommend a mouse pad for gaming.Aside from the build quality, the way it feels, and all the thoughtful features, I like the modern additions on this mouse. I have so many wireless mice and this is the only one with a USB-C port. No wireless charging on this model but due to the long battery life, it's really not needed. Just charge it once a month (they claim a battery life of 70 days but I have a reminder set to charge it at the end of each month to be consistent). If you do run the battery all the way down, one minute of charging will last 3 hours. Another interesting feature of this mouse is the ability to pair it to 3 different computers via Bluetooth by flipping a switch on the bottom and it works great on both OSX or Windows 10. I did not have a chance to test on Linux. I don't use the Bluetooth feature, I prefer to use the dongle. It's absolutely not needed if you use Bluetooth, but I prefer the dongle because it's just a bit faster and if you use this mouse for gaming at all, you will notice a difference in response time.If I had to list one reason why I'm giving this mouse 5 stars, it's the scroll wheel. It really is incredible and hard to explain in a review. You can go from scrolling one line or pixel at a time to flying down a long document. It's really incredible and by far the best feature of this mouse and the best scroll wheel I've ever used. If you are looking for a top productivity mouse for graphic design, coding/development, or just want a really nice mouse - this is the one I'm going to recommend. It's not cheap but you can really feel the quality as soon as you put your hand on it.",30-Sep-19
2081,Jess,1,The mouse is thinner as a result your pinky finger and ring finger are just hanging instead of resting on the mouse 2 and 1 were better.,30-Sep-19
2082,J. Peplinski,5,"This is a great upgrade mouse for anyone who codes or develops all day long. I love all the customizations you can do to the buttons, and make them specific to different applications. It is a little on the pricey side, but there are so many additional features, I think it makes it worth it.Pros: • Easy to setup - worked with the receiver on my work computer straight away. • Could connect to either USB receiver or Bluetooth  • Can stay connected to three computers at the same time  • Can be used on nearly any surface, even glass • Rechargeable integrated battery with USB-C. (Though don't expect to use the USB-C cable that comes with other devices - only the one that came with the mouse worked to charge it). • Can set up unique uses of all the extra buttons for just about any application you have. The ability to customize by application makes this mouse really special. You can even put keyboard shortcuts onto buttons. Imagine you have a VBA macro in Excel mapped to a keyboard shortcut. You can trigger the shortcut with a single button click.Cons: • The extra features like the scroll wheel required me to download the Logitech options application, which required me to setup an account. I understand the need for the app if you want to change from the default settings, but I don't know why it wouldn't come shipped with the defaults loaded. (I'm guessing to grab some email addresses). • Since the customizations only work on the computer where the app is installed, if you have an Enterprise workstation where you can't install just any application, you might not be able to use all the customizations on your work computer. • It would be great if it came with a hard shell case to offer some protection.Overall, the pros far exceed the cons with this mouse. There are so many customizations you can do with this - the possibilities are endless.",28-Sep-19
2083,DB,1,"Sadly after all these years, the MX Revolution is still the best mouse ever made. I also appreciate the click button responsiveness of the Performance MX mouse. The MX Master series (1,2 and now 3) all have click buttons that are not springy/clicky/responsive (however you want to put it) enough. After about an hour of use, the click buttons become mushy, in that the don't travel and rebound well enough to make using it a snappy and enjoyable experience. Cheap parts? Inability to listen to customer feedback?  I don't know. I'm just disappointed. If anybody knows a workaround to make the click buttons more responsive, I'd love to hear it.",27-Sep-19
2084,M. PRESTON,5,"An absolute joy to use. Wireless performs flawlessly. Keybindings are excellent. Mouse has kept charge for 4 days under gaming sessions &amp; research applications. Exceptionally comfortable while using palm OR claw grip. Both scroll wheels are the best i've touched so far. Worth every penny , and better than most high end gaming mice costing twice as much.",26-Sep-19
2085,Nerdy Narwhal,4,"I have been using this mouse for the past four days.  I was eager to test out this mouse because I love my Logitech keyboard (the G815), even though I was already using a precise gaming mouse (the Viper Razer).The MX Master 3 is wireless, but it needs to charge via a usb cable.  According to the info sheet included with the mouse, a 3 minute charge will keep the mouse running for a full day, and a day of charging will run the mouse for up to 70 days.  I charged it for 10 minutes before using it the first day, and have had it charging at night while we sleep the past two nights.  The mouse has been going strong and has not had any power issues.The mouse connects to the computer with a small usb receiver.  I put it in one of the front ports of the computer because it was easier than fully swapping the mice.  My Razer is still connected, but is tucked away beside the tower.Shape-wise, this is the most comfortable and hand-conforming mouse that I have had in my hand.  It is just a bit too large and high off of the mouse pad to be comfortable for my smaller hand to use for hours on end.  I am 5'3"" and wear women's small to medium gloves.  If you have larger hands, this will probably not be an issue for you.  A wrist pad would also help, but that won't work with my desk layout.The scroll wheel is very sensitive and I love it.  The movement is responsive and precise, just as precise as my Razer, but way more precise than a cheapo ball mouse or an inexpensive optic mouse.The mouse is very easy to install and set up.  I was using the mouse within minutes of charging it.  It is customizable with Logitech software.I will be switching back to my Razer, but only because it fits better in my little hands for long periods of use.  If they made a smaller version of this mouse for smaller handed people, I'd be all over it.",23-Sep-19
2086,Kindle Customer,5,"I really don't have any complaints other than the price, but I paid it and I think it was worth it so far.Update: ok, I do have one complaint. There is no place in the mouse to store the receiver. The fact that it also uses bluetooth prevents me from deducting a star, but I am afraid I will lose the receiver.",22-Sep-19
2087,Eyewire,1,"Very disappointed, he mouse can even compared with the Apple Magic Mouse. The scroll is lagging and jittering. Do try it if you want to use with Mac.",21-Sep-19
2088,Eva,5,"I upgraded to the MX Master 3 from a Logitech M510, and am very happy with it so far. It has a unique look for a mouse, but it's very comfortable to hold. The size is just right, and it feels ergonomically-friendly. Vertical scrolling is super smooth, which is a big difference from my previous mouse. The thumb wheel on the side helps navigate wide documents and spreadsheets.I use a mouse for things like photo editing, text editing, and gaming, so I’m finding all the extra features very useful. For those who want to get into specific customization, the Logitech Options software lets you tweak the scrolling speed, direction, sensitivity, etc. There are many more options than any mouse I've had so far. It also allows you to copy text from one computer and paste it on another, which is a cool feature.As far as compatibility, the MX Master 3 can work with three different computers. I’m using it with two: a Windows and a Mac. Switching back and forth is very easy. There’s a little button on the bottom to switch between computers. It also works with Linux.It connects via a small plug-in USB receiver or via Bluetooth. Those with newer Macs that have only the USB-C slots will need to connect via Bluetooth or use a USB adapter.This mouse has been great so far, and I’ve had no trouble with it. It's accurate, feels well-made, and makes working on the computer much easier for me.",19-Sep-19
2089,Scott,4,"I have the MX Master 2S and loved everything about that mouse except for the placement of the thumb forward back web browser buttons. Overlapping them means you never click the right one.The MX Master 3 finally separated the buttons so you can distinguish with feel quicker which one you want. The design is slightly different so I will need to get used to it after using the 2S for 2 years....no big deal as its just as comfortable.It's a very precise mouse just like its predecessor. I think the click is more solid and also slightly quieter... I don't know why companies still make the click sound....i kind of feel it's not necessary anymore. Especially if you are click happy like myself.You can customize buttons as needed like other previous models. I have mine hooked up via bluetooth on a mac. You do need to use your old mouse to set things up first as the new mouse isn't connected yet, unless you use the usb plug, then its connectedRecharging is easy with the usb/c connector. I wish that it was usb-c on both sides or at least an adapter included because when i get my new mac i'll now have to get an adapter or unplug usb 3 plugs to recharge. However, it is way easier to recharge as the old usb mini was such a pain to plug into the mouse.Only wish it came in colors too...my fav is blue but maybe in the future?",19-Sep-19

2091,NC,1,I have the former MX Master 2S and upgraded to the 3. All seems fine except the scrolling with the scroll wheel. After about 3 turns of the wheel the web pages don't scroll consistently (tried multiple browsers) as if the wheel turning is not being detected internally properly. I tried the same with the 2S again and no scroll issues so something is definitely wrong with this mouse. Put in for a defective item replacement and hope it's just this one mouse. Will update this review if the replacement fixes the problem.Edit: I forgot to mention that I bought this updated MX Master 3 hoping the macOS bluetooth jittery cursor issues would be fixed as there are known bluetooth problems with macOS with the MX Master 2S. Sadly they were not fixed and it's still jittery on a Mac.,18-Sep-19
2092,LifeIsGood,5,"Hands down, the best mouse I've ever used.  I've used standard mice, ergonomic mice, and trackballs, but none of them compare to the comfort of this mouse.  The shape is ergonomic but more familiar to the hand, so you get the benefit without the awkward adjustment period.  The two scroll wheels (yes, two!) seem like they should have been done years ago.  They naturally scroll as you'd expect (one by top goes up and down while the one on the side goes side to side, wow!) but you can also push the top one and zoom around also.  With the two other buttons on the side and one on the bottom under your thumb, you almost never need to take your hand off the mouse to move around web pages or switch applications.  The software (188MB download, yikes!!) lets you do more customizations, including some nifty features in MS Office applications.  As good as all this is, my favorite part is the sensor.  My desktop is high gloss so most mice just get lost, forcing me to buy a new mouse pad every year or so.  No more!  Not only does this work, it works well!  I really can't say enough good things about this mouse (rechargeable battery, hello!).  It's my new best friend!",18-Sep-19
2093,Steve and Amy,4,"9/29/19 Update: This mouse doesn't scroll in Calendar on the Mac. I sent an email to an address that was on a separate piece of paper that said it would be sent directly to the marketing director. But I received a response obviously from an outsourced support person who didn't appear to read my email but sent a scripted response asking for information that I had already sent. Unfortunately, support appears to be a long and tedious process if there is any.------------------------------------------------------------------------While I liked the size and shape of the mouse that came with my iMac plus swiping across the top to switch desktops, etc I always had a problem with getting it to click left or right, at least half of the time it would do the opposite even when I consciously place my fingers correctly. I got to where I hated the Apple mouse. This one is a decent replacement as long as you install additional software that is required to be downloaded from Logitech website not the App Store.Button placement is great and of course separate so that I know when I click left or right.While there is no swipe pad you can, after installing the software and letting it access settings, customize all of the buttons and rollers on the mouse. So I use the roller on the side to switch desktops.It is huge in comparison to the Apple mouse but I do like the shape and feel in my hand. But there is one tiny button right under your thumb that is hard to press so I set it to a seldom used function like accessing the desktop list at the top of the screen.You can also use this with up to three computers and literally swipe between them or press a button on the bottom of the mouse to use it with a different computer which works really well.And, where Apple really failed, you can charge this while you use it!Overall, I like this mouse as a replacement for the Apple mouse.",17-Sep-19

2097,Brain Wash,4,"This is my first MX Master mouse. I plan to use it for my 3d design work, and so far I think it will definitely hold up well. Here are some pros and cons I've observed in my first 24 hours using it. First of all, I absolutely love the scroll wheel. It is quiet, smooth, and very satisfying. I suggest turning up the ""Smartshift Sensitivity"" in the Logitech Options software. That reduces how easily the ratcheting wheel switches to free scrolling. I have it all the way up to like 85%. With this change, it is much more intuitive feeling for me. The laser works great on all surfaces I've tried so far. Bluetooth connection is very responsive, but I had to turn off a setting on my laptop that was putting the bluetooth receiver to sleep after like 3 seconds of inactivity. My complaints are that the gesture button location feels just out of natural reach. I also don't love the grip of it yet, the palm section of the mouse comes out very far which encourages a slightly more vertical grip. I know this is good for me so I'll try to embrace it, but I'm sure it will take some getting used to. All in all it seems like it will be a great mouse.",12-Sep-19

2099,Customer,5,"The MX Master 2s was a fantastic mouse, but I had two complaints about it: 1, It used Micro USB instead of Type C and 2, the thumb wheel and navigation buttons were hard to use.The MX Master 3 fixes both those problems. The thumb wheel now has a very high quality feel to it and is very easy to spin around, and they've moved the navigation buttons lower down to make them easier to press with your thumb. The main scrollwheel has also been made quieter, and somehow even more fun to use.As before, this mouse works on pretty much all surfaces, can connect to 3 devices, and can connect by either bluetooth or a USB dongle. I've had no issues using it on both a Mac and PC.Logitech claims a battery life of 70 days, and while I obviously haven't been able to test that out yet, if the MX Master 2S is anything to go by, you can expect great battery life on this mouse too.",7-Sep-19

2135,Tom,5,"I got this as an upgrade to Anywhere, whose battery started to loose its charge. It works well, more silent with better ergonomics. Very good for productivity. Recommended",10-Oct-22
2136,Carol Loiseau,5,It is very comfortable to use and eases the pain in my hands and wrist,7-Oct-22
2137,Amazon Customer,1,The cursors stutters and freezes.  Often times the sensitivity changes.,6-Oct-22
2138,Tyler,4,"The mouse is excellent - it's important to note that the difference between the 3 and 3S is that the click is silent. The only tech complaint I have is a singular random disconnect over the course of months upon months of 40 hour work weeks.Regarding build quality, the back foot has very slightly peeled, which is the only reason I deducted a star. I wish there was a way to store the dongle within the mouse as well, but that's not a dealbreaker. Fantastic product.",5-Oct-22

2140,ZJW,5,"I have been an mx master user for years. I bought this as my old mx master (1st gen) coudn't click. The ergonomic is comfortable There are two minor issues that you may pay attention: 1. the size is overly big to me. I solved this issue by adding a wrist support pad. 2. The white colour is eazy to get stain, especially the area of placing my thumb. If you really care about keeping the mouse a clean apperance, you'd better select black colour.",4-Oct-22
2141,Shopperguy,5,Great product. Easy recommend,4-Oct-22
2142,Mateo,5,You can feel the relief on your hand. It’s really fun to use,4-Oct-22
2143,Scott Gall,4,I especially like the feel of the magnetic scroll wheel. Their software for it could use work though.,30-Sep-22
2144,alexandre desroches,3,I tried to love this mouse twice and returned it twice on two different model version... it feels wierd to hold compared to their 40$ model M705. I don't understand how people hold their mouse if this really is ergonomic. To me it's not right. Can't click accurately cause I am always thinking about that wierd handling while I work so I returned it.,28-Sep-22
2145,Joel G,5,"It’s a good freaking mouse. You’ve probably already watched or read all the reviews there are so you know what you’re getting. I guess all I can say is it works consistently as expected and feels good. I like the scroll wheel although a lot of people in the reviews don’t. And I love that’s it’s USB C which makes it easy to charge no matter where I am even though it’s not very often that I even need to. And the USB A plug in thing is so painless when you don’t want to go through all the setup on another person’s device. It’s not something you need but once you use it, it makes it really hard to go back to a different mouse and god-forbid, a wired mouse.",17-Sep-22
2146,kelvinwang,2,"The mouse in general is very nice, but don't know why, only used it a few times, right now when I click on the side key, it has a very cheap loud plastic noise, a much bigger noticeable noise than all the other keys. For this money, and for this quality, I'm very disappointed. Don't know how they controled the quality.",13-Sep-22

2151,Andrew Toronto,5,It lives up to its advertising. Very comfortable and I really like the programability feature. Money well invested!,31-Aug-22
2152,Tony,4,Like the feel of the mouse and capabilities. Use single mouse for two computers. But switching between computers requires changing the switch at the bottom of mouse. Slight inconvenience.,28-Aug-22
2153,Patrick,5,Really enjoyed using this mouse. I find the clicking sound on regular mice too loud and this one is almost in-audible. The button placement and overall ergonomics are excellent. It's paired to an Imac and Windows computer and can seamlessly switch between them with the toggle button on the bottom.,28-Aug-22
2154,Greg,5,"They quoted battery life of up to 70 days and now I am charging mine for the first time and it has been about 60 days since I received it.  That's pretty accurate and since I hate those gaming mice you have to charge every few days, I'm pleased with its performance.  It's very ergonomic and is great for gaming.  Overall, probably the best mouse I've ever owned in the 3 decades I've been using a PC for gaming and work.",27-Aug-22

2156,Varun Atre,5,"This mouse is the best option in this price range for many people who work on desks for about 8-9 hours, as wrist pain is a real productivity killer. I searched the internet for many options to reduce and completely eliminate wrist pain so I can work for those amount of hours without having to rotate my wrist to relieve the pain every 20 minutes.Don't hesitate before buying this mouse. Clicks are quieter. Sensor is smoother. Ergonomics are just perfect.",20-Aug-22
2157,Karen,5,"I have a remote job and continuously using a regular mouse for 8hrs was causing my hand to swell. After buying this ergonomic mouse, my hand hasn’t swelled once.

Vertical scrolling is amazing. All the buttons are programmable which is an extra benefit. Moreover, the mouse can be used over any surface literally. Overall, I am highly satisfied with this purchase.",12-Aug-22
2162,Rez,2,"After one day of using it decided to return :Pros:-Works on any surface.-Slightly better placement of charging port-Button configuration for each programCons:-MX Master 3S Does not work with old unifying receiver. If you have an older Logitech product you will end up using two usb receivers. This one does not work with the older unifying dongle and the older ones don't work with the new Bolt dongle + you have to install two Logitech software on your PC for configuring each one.-uncomfortable for large hands. It is narrower than the first MX Master and doesn't have a good grip.  While using it, my 4th finger is rubbing mouse pad.

2163,Sundara R.,5,I used several mouse products so far. This is the best ever mouse I used. I am not a gamer. Light weight and smooth operation.,6-Aug-22
2164,Jennifer,3,"The first inconvenient thing is that there is no compartment to store mouse dongle. Not sure why they remove it but it is a big mistake. Most of the time we don't need to use the dongle because the mouse has bluetooth connection. However, we need to carry the dongle in case the Bluetooth in some devices don't work. The second thing is that I have white color mouse and it is easily to get stains (finger print mark) from my fingers in daily use (unless my fingers are super duper clean). These stains are impossible to clean, I have tried to use water, alcohol, disinfection wiper but nothing works. My mouse looks dirty now even though I use it carefully. My model is MX Master 3S. I wish I can change to black color.",6-Aug-22

2169,Dr. D,2,"-This mouse is not designed for medium and small hands. It is not ergonomic at all for these sizes.-This mouse is not for gaming-Mine was lagging a lot. Impossible to do any task.-Good for productivity if you have larger hands.-The scroll wheel on the left side is a bit hard to get used to. I didn't like it. It interferes with your work. You can disable it anytime but does not worth the investment.-There are plenty of better and cheaper options out there. Sometimes expansiveness is not related to suitability to develop a specific task. I am a researcher, and I always type; that's what I do for a living, but I found a cheaper option for my hand size, ' Razer Orchy V2'. Way more affordable, and if you like causal gaming, this is by far a better option.-Battery life is great.-I hope Logitech can offer more suitable solutions for middle/ small hands in the future. They don't advertise this anywhere.-Quality of the product, no complaints.",28-Jul-22

It’s great for work like the side scrolling in excel sheets. I keep having to remind myself that the mouse has these functionalities when I’m working as I sometimes default to my ways before. It’s mad comfortable too and switching computers is really seamless. I tried gaming with it, but don’t really recommend it and it’s not what the mouse is for. Highly recommend this to anyone wanting a good mouse. I was stuck between this one and the mx vertical one my coworker has but after using his, the mouse kept tipping over if u let go of it whilst moving. Needless to say I’m happy with my purchase",19-Jul-22
2174,Aka,2,"Decent wireless mouse with good connection and clicks, but can be bulky with hard to reach buttons and feels heavy when using it all day. But the worst part is the scroll wheel which has really poor registration, especially when scrolling up which seems to ""miss"" 10-30% of the time. Seems to be a pretty common issue which is rather unacceptable at this price.",18-Jul-22
2175,Nick,1,"I ordered this mouse with high expectations due to the high price &amp; build quality, but the scroll wheel was very disappointing. The scrolling is INCREDIBLY inconsistent &amp; horribly inaccurate compared to what they advertise. It's like spinning your tires in a racecar before actually starting to move... sometimes it doesn't even respond. Also, the magnetic system beneath the scroll wheel lags behind your scroll movements, creating a thumping sound/feeling in the mouse and even more issues when scrolling quickly. For reference, I used another bluetooth Logitech mouse at work (probably $40-$50) and the scrolling was 100% accurate.There should be no scrolling issues for such an expensive mouse... but there are!",16-Jul-22

The MX 3S is a nice fit for large hands, and shows no appreciable latency lag. I don't care about the vaunted silent button click, since I usually wear ANC headphones.<br>However, it does not come with any instructions to indicate you need to go to the Logitech site to download the software to customise it and use all the features and customize the buttons and functions.Also, Logitech does not provide its control apps (Options and Options+) to the Microsoft store, only as download on its own site. This means these mice don't work well on Windows S-mode devices, since they can only run apps from the Microsoft store. The mice will function as basic, non-customizable devices in S mode, but features like the variable scroll wheel, and thumb wheel won't function without Options (or Options+). If you use an S-mode device, look for a less-expensive, basic mouse until Logitech makes Options+ available on the Microsoft store.</br>",29-Jun-22

2184,Dan,4,"This mouse has a lot of good features to it. I like the thumb rest button and the infinite scroll wheel the most, also being able to reprogram the buttons for different applications is really useful.I have only used the wireless dongle for the mouse, I do not have Bluetooth on my computer to test that connectivity out. The wireless dongle works very well, I haven't seen any slow response or disconnects. It does support 3 devices on Bluetooth but I haven't used the feature to see how well it works. Also you can't switch devices easily from just the mouse controls itself, you have to press the button underneath the mouse to switch to another device.I've been using it for a week now and have not had to charge it since the first charge. There is no easy way to check the charge of the mouse, you have to open the Logi options software to view its charge level. I'll have to try it in Bluetooth mode to see if it shows a charge in Windows.The only gripe I have for it is that, I have smaller hands and the mouse is quite large, I'm not able to reach all the buttons unless I adjust my hand placement each time. Due to this it's not a great mouse for gaming where you would need quick access to all the buttons on the mouse.I do wish that they had an ambidextrous version that could add more buttons, so that I could program more specific macros to them.Overall the mouse is great for productivity tasks and office applications, it is okay for gaming depending on the game you're playing, it's good for non competitive single player games, I wouldn't suggest it for competitive games that need precise actions. The wireless worked seamlessly and the software it comes with allows you to program different button actions depending on the application you're using.",22-Jun-22

And it actually tells you when its low, unlike dying mid game on my previous mouse.I personally feel like the build quality is good, some people that have used previous versions might feel this iteration not as solid. But lets be honest, inflation is going to either make things cost more, or build quality must be lowered to sell at the same price. And you don't need your mouse to be built like a rock.The scrolling is really nice. It comes with two options of smooth scroll vs. standard scroll. The smooth scroll is not very accurate so I prefer to set it to standard scroll. This would be the only negative I can think of.",11-Mar-22

Maybe it's only me.All in all more durable than 2s and better in most aspects.",14-Feb-22

<span> I purchased both the MX Master 3 and the MX Anywhere 3 and the scroll wheel in ratchet mode is very loud while scrolling and it sounds like there is something rattling inside.",2-Feb-22
2223,Giacomo,4,"This mouse is retailed at $125.You purchase it then you get stuck in the world of Logitech compatibility issues.Like me, if you are looking to purchase the MX Master Mini keyboard ($115-125), make sure you scour the web for the MX Master 3 Professional mouse become the MX Master 3 I purchased at the end of 2021 (DEC) does not support the new Logi Bolt usb.And don’t be alarmed if once you do finally find this newer MX Master 3 Professional that the new Logi Bolt unifying receiver is not included and you will need to shell out another $25 dollars for that.So after approximately ~$275 or so dollars, time wasted trying to figure out why the damn things are no sinking together. Send back the Keyboard if you ended up purchasing it.Realizing this company is using slick promotion realizing they have two of the same products on the market with just a small tiny logo on the bottom of it.All that to say .. it is a superb mouse!! Probably the last one you’ll want to use, baring the semi Bluetooth drops.. but due to the ergonomics (fits my hand perfectly). I also have the G502 Hero for gaming; that was a year previous purchase and only reason why I gave the MX Master 3 a look after raving reviews from previous iteration owners.Great mouse.. but last investment put into Logitech! Sneaky advertising is just poor business practice!To this day they’re still swindling people on their site.You’ll love the mouse! Not the manufacturer!! And they don’t care!!!5 stars for the mouse itseft! A minus infinity to the company!",31-Jan-22
2224,Manu Kamath,4,As compared to my previous MX Anywhere this definitely an upgrade.I use it mostly with design softwares like Sketch and Figma on a Mac.The good:- Works with Bluetooth right out of the box.- Set up is mostly straight forward- Customization options are also easy to configure.- The smart scroll is a bit weird at first but once you get used to it it's kinda nice for those extra long scrolls.- I like the ergonomics. My hand position doesn't feel weird and for my smallish hands it is a good fit.- There are a lot more Mac friendly gestures and buttons right out the box.- Easy to connect to multiple devices and switch between them.The button on the base is slightly difficult to get used to but the second scroll wheel is easy to use.The bad:- Logi Options software needs a restart before it can start recognising your mouse.- The scroll would suddenly stop working. When this happes just go into your Mac Accessibility Settings and allow Logi Options in the list along with Logi Daemon.- This was particularly bad since scroll is the most used feature and you wouldn't think of such a thing to happen.Otherwise it is a solid mouse for a variety of work flows. I haven't gamed with it but I am sure there are much better gaming mice that Logitech offers.,30-Jan-22

2230,Prasanna Bhalerao,5,"This is a combined review for Logitech MX Keys and MX Master 3 mouse. I purchased them together.I have an iMac 5K and Windows Laptop with 27"" monitor. I was struggling (for space) with two KBs and two mice. So while looking for the solution, I found the perfect answer - the MX combo. I read about the duo. These are fairly expensive but they have significantly increased my productivity. I have connected to both systems via BlueTooth (we can use the dongles also). Now I can simply move my mouse across and seamlessly connect to Mac or Windows and the KB too connects across. The two behave like two bodies and one soul! I can copy/paste across two systems as diverse as Mac and Windows. I have a provision to connect to a third system. Having freed the clutter on the desk has made my life so much easy. The desk looks clean also and of course, there are no wires.The KB is solid aluminium and does not feel cheap. To date, I was using plastic keyboards. While they are not bad, this KB takes me to a different realm. The keys are illuminated and activated by the hand motion sensor. The keys are low profile - so some who like mechanical keys and long travel keystrokes may not like this. I prefer this way.The mouse is so easy on the hand and is possibly the best in business. It has programmable keys and I can have keys specific to Word, Excel, Photoshop, etc. The scrolling is smooth. There is normal vertical scrolling, superfast vertical scrolling. I have horizontal thumb scrolling and a tiny recessed button to save (below the thumb). I have read some negative feedback on the system switch button (1-2-3) at the mouse bottom and being inconvenient but let me assure you that if Logi Options software is installed, the flow from one desktop to another is just by moving the mouse. It can be further restricted by having to press the control key to prevent accidental movement to next desktop screen.Finally, both the devices can be charged by a cable and it connects by USB-C port on the devices. I am told that a single charge is sufficient to last over two months. Let's see. I used to own the first MX Master Mouse and if it has one flaw it was the charging dock. Over time, the gold plated contacts wore off and the mouse became a paperweight. This has been corrected by a sturdier USB charging port.In summary, I will highly recommend this, especially to those having multiple systems. But even if you have a single system, you cannot go wrong - except maybe your pockets will become shallower.  For this, I am docking off one point for VFM. Since I do not play games (not that I am against gaming), I am unable to comment on that aspect.p/s. I also purchased the desk mat that is seen in the pic. It enhances the desk and makes it look really good.",14-Jan-22

As others have said, it is rather large, my hands aren’t small, but this thing really feels oddly shaped in them.Also, the ergonomics of it is poor, I could feel the pull in my wrist as I used it.

2243,Andy,2,"Died within a year of use, sad. Bad quality, the mouse wheel lock mechanism broke, and clicking doesn't work half the time. Not even a year of use. Just poor build/part quality. About 8 hours of use a day for work, 5 times a week for the last 7 months. At first I thought it was the drivers, nope, it's the mouse itself. You click somewhere, it doesn't register as a click although you're clicking. Also stops tracking intermittently. The mouse wheel lock mechanism is broken as well, instead of doing the tactile hard scroll it just goes and goes. Tested this on multiple machines.Now, when it actually works, pretty sweet. But, I mean, less than a year and it's dead? Garbo, not going for logitech products after this mouse. It's not an inexpensive product too.",16-Dec-21
2244,Manny,4,"In MacOS, Logitech Options does not detect mouse via Bluetooth therefore the advanced features cannot be used.

2253,Infoyoda,1,"C'mon - we all know this is way too much to pay for a bloody mouse - but I wanted the best. I really thought I was about to upgrade my computing experience. The Logitech Unifying Device has no drivers for Windows 10 and the operating system is not shy about telling you that. You can connect via bluetooth, but that seems flakey and it drops the connection intermittently but reliably - probably the only reliable quality I've seen in action. This was a waste of time, money, and effort. I'm going with anyone else.",30-Nov-21

All 3 pads have scratches and clear signs of some decent amount of usage already. I’m gonna have to return this one because I think it’s a used one, still gonna give this mouse a 4 star though",27-Nov-21
2255,Jean-P T.,3,"Scrolling :<br>I did not notice it at first but at some point I noticed the scrolling is inconsistent : making the same motion multiple times does not always result in the same scrolling, which is quite annoying. I'm not sure yet if this was just a temporary issue or a common issue. I found a few people having this issue on reddit and I tried changing the mouse settings but it did not help. I tried another wireless mouse (Razer Viper Ultimate) and I don't have this issue.EDIT : it appears to be less apparent on my work laptop, some users think this is related to wireless signal interferencesSize :Despite the mouse being larger than the G502, the grip is smaller (58mm vs 63mm according to rtings). This being said, you can grip the larger base somehow so it offers way larger than 58mm, which you can't do as easily with the G502. This is great (for me) because I think being able to switch to a larger grip makes it easier on the hand : same concept as for a chair, you need to change position to avoid ""hurting"" your body on the long run.Weight :I tried a few mice recently, the HyperX pulsefire (and cool master mm720) feels the best so far, it's much lighter so it feels effortless to move, it feels easier to be precise. The MX Master 3 is the heaviest I tried and my least favourite. If you want a lighter wireless mouse, I like the Razer Viper Ultimate which you can order with a dock, pretty useful for ""wireless charging"".Height :The MX Master height is quite high which might encourage you to put your wrist in a more extended position, which does not feel as confortable and is probably worst for the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. I guess it depends on you end up holding that mouse because there ways to avoid the extended position.DPI :No big deal but you can't set DPI via Logitech Options+, instead you set Pointer Speed. I think it would have been more logical to use the DPI approach like other mice.USB Cable :You can use the mouse while wired, which is nice. This being said, the cable is only used to charge, it can't be used to control the mouse, it only uses wireless so you can't use the mouse without the logitech Unifying usb receiver plugged in your PC and used for wireless. The usb cable is quite short, I found a workaround by pluging it in my keyboard usb port (some monitors also have usb ports).Gestures :It looked like a good idea, as long as you remember all gestures but the only useful gesture I found for me is by setting the ""click"" opens ""This PC"".Side wheel :I have keyboard corsair k70 lux rgb which also as a wheel which I integrated with Lightroom using macros in iCue, it works well. I tried doing the same with the Logitech mouse and it worked. So that's a good point (almost the only one?). But I think the best setup for Lightroom is using a MIDI controller, which I have not tried yet.I tried a few workarounds to fix some issues, like a wrist pad to help with the height, and a usb cable extender to help with dongle signal, changing the settings in Logitech Options+.For me the biggest downside is the inconsistent scrolling, it's not that bad but it's quite annoying, I tried 2 MX master 3 and both had this issue.</br>",25-Nov-21

2258,Wyatt Gosling,4,"This is probably the best ""professional"" mouse. I could not find a competing mouse with the same features, and they all work well.The hardware is great.* It feels high quality.* It has soft in places where you grip it, then hard materials where you click (soft materials just wear out).* It moves as smoothly as any other mouse I've had.* It has a horizontal scroll wheel!!!* The gesture button works very well. I was prepared for this to feel like a gimmick, but it is legitimately useful.* Being able to pair with 3 devices is great.Flaws:* I use a fingertip grip with mice. The place where my pinky grips is starting to wear a bit. It so far hasn't worn thru the soft plastic, which does imply a thicker coating than many mice get.* If you palm the mouse, it is probably a bit small. The gesture button would be hard to hit.* Sometimes when I pick up the mouse to hit the button that switches devices, and it just does nothing. Flicking the power switch always resolves this.* Being able to remap buttons on an app-by-app basics is fantastic.Those are pretty minor complaints for the hardware. Mouse mice are much worse.The real criticisms are with the software.* While this is a professional product, the software package looks like it was designed by the gaming department. It is as tacky looking as software could look.* The default settings for the mouse are terrible. The pointer speed, scrolling speed, and mappings for the gesture button are all weird. It even has some app specific settings that are bad (it defaults the horizontal scroll wheel to ""change tab"" for web browsers. Web browsers are one of few apps where horizontal scrolling is a thing...). This is only a problem because:* Sometimes when the mouse wakes up or swaps devices, it won't load your settings for that device. The only way I've found to deal with this situation is to reboot the device. This happens on average twice a week.* If you don't use their suggested settings for an app, it will show a notification in the top right of the settings app.* None of the slider bars have tick marks or show the numeric value. This makes it fiddly to manually copy settings from device to device.* Logitech probably justifies this by saying to use their syncing system, but it is blocked by my work VPN so it is a non option. Also the privacy policy they make you agree to is awful. I'd break my work's security policies if I agreed to it, which is probably why they blocked the server.* The maximum horizontal wheel speed is quite low. The wheel doesn't spin freely, which is probably meant to prevent unintended scrolling, but the software should allow setting it higher. The highest setting for the horizontal wheel is about the same as the lowest setting for the vertical wheel.* The battery level only shows 3 levels: high, medium, and low. Even cheap mice show a percentage.* Some of the options for the gesture button work by simulating keyboard presses. This means you can't change the key binding. Other mice I've used by Razor can invoke these functions directly, which allows changing the key binding.",20-Nov-21

2260,Amazon.ca Customer,2,"Bought to accompany the great MX Keys. Although the mouse looks great and feels nice in the hand, scrolling just doesn't work if you make quick movements on the wheel. If you navigate up and down by making short, quick flicking scrolls, then you will hate this mouse - the page either stays in place or scrolls by one or two units with each flick, rather than with unit pip per detent you feel (which is how every other mouse works). The horizontal scrolling never seemed to work right either even after installing the logitech software.",6-Nov-21
2261,Lily,5,"Ergonomic mouse, saved my arm and wrist from developing carpal tunnel",5-Nov-21
2262,Chuck,4,"Let me start off by saying that I am NOT gaming with this mouse. I use it in my day to day work, in programming and some 3D design which relies quite heavily on the middle button/ scroll wheel.If you start reading around online, without a doubt the issues you are likely to see most often are surrounding the scroll wheel. There are two problems I found come up quite often: connectivity and behavior. I use this mouse with a MacBook Pro over bluetooth, and at first I found the scrolling a bit inconsistent and occasionally after my laptop had gone to sleep, the mouse would work except the scroll wheel. Turning it off and on was not helping.Finally, (MacOS) I found that going into my System Settings &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Accessibility and enabling the setup software 'Logi Options', fixed the issues for me - especially the scroll wheel being disabled after the laptop went to sleep.While it is not going to be a silver bullet for everyone, I attached my current settings in Logi Options. I find that most of the time I have the ratcheting disabled on my scroll wheel, and when I need more precise smaller increments I enable the ratcheting. But things seem good for me now.",5-Nov-21
2263,Evan Huang,5,"First off, the ergonomics are great. I noticed my grip instantly became more relaxed when I started using this mouse compared to my old one. Only potential problem with ergonomics is the pronounced uppermost bump. It fits fine in my hands with slightly more pressure than the rest of the mouse, but it could get in the way if you have smaller hands. The overall size is perfect for my medium-large sized hands and claw grip.But my favourite part is the side scroll wheel combined with the Logitech Options software. I can find a use for the side scroll wheel in almost every application, and the Options software makes it super easy to set application specific mappings.I also don't have any issues with the scroll wheel aside from SmartShift not responding well. SmartShift lets the scroll wheel spin freely but the page doesn't always scroll with it, so I just keep it off and it works a lot better. The scroll wheel is probably the best one I've ever used. The button above it allows you to quickly switch between smooth and click-to-click scrolling. I use smooth scrolling for relaxed use and click-to-click when I need to be more accurate.",3-Nov-21
2264,lecep,5,This is a gret mouse.  Installation was very simple and it allows for several customizations.  Not only you can customize the buttons ingeneral but also depending on the appication you're running.A minor issue is that it won't work as a wired mouse when connecting to USB charger cable; it still needs the wireless (or bluetooth) connectivity; battery last long enough so it's not a big deal anyway.,1-Nov-21

Has a lot of configurable features, very smooth operations, light.Ergonomic design is great, thought in my case this design caused strain on one of my wrist ligaments - it is the way I use mouse.Scroll wheelThe feature I love the most is free-wheeling scroll (scroll wheel is very light in operation), its tactile feedback. The scroll button push (ie. mouse middle-button) needs stronger pressure, which makes it extremely comfortable in use - operations on the scroll wheel are not interrupted by accidental middle-button clicks, as in in light-push scroll wheel designs, which saves your wrist ligaments.I wish all mice on the market had this design.Note: I haven't used it games, mainly programming work",23-Jul-21

2322,Steph,5,"Pros:- The new mag scroll wheel is quite nice, much quieter than the older mechanical ones.- Uses USB C- Multi device supportCons:- The side buttons feel a bit mushy to my liking.- Can't login to my Logitech account on the Logitech Options software on Mac, works fine on Windows. This does not affect the flow feature however you can still go from one computer to the next, it auto switches Bluetooth/receiver to go to next computer, there is slight lag of a few seconds while it switches.- Gestures might take a while to get used to. It's similar to the sniper buttons or g toggle you have on some of the gaming mice, you hold it down and move the mouse in a direction to perform ""gestures""- Needs extended pinky rest so that pinky finger isn't dragging or rubbing the surface.Overall, I specifically bought the mouse for the hyperscroll feature as it is very useful for going through documentation, USB C is a welcome expected upgrade, I have not experienced any of the scrolling issues others have mentioned.",6-Jun-21

2337,Danny Sit,1,Ordered one of these in December 2020 and it worked perfectly. They then got sold out and became in-stock again some time in March 2021. They must've changed manufacturers or materials (or BOTH) because the new one I order in March 2021 has a very loud left and right mouse button clicks and a whizzing sound from the scroll wheel. These sounds are non-existent in the one I ordered in December 2020.I tried getting a replacement and the issue still persists.

2342,Amazon Customer,5,"Coming from a Logitech Performance MX, which for me was the ultimate productivity mouse for a decade (yes, I really held onto it that long), I finally found a worthy successor in the MX Master 3.For my hand, the ergonomics and layout of the Performance MX were excellent. I bought the MX 2S and gave it away because it was so uncomfortable and the layout of the back/forward buttons was borderline unusable.I decided to bite the bullet and give the MX 3 a try, and I'm not disappointed. It's almost as comfortable to hold as the Performance MX, and has a logical button layout. The USB Type C is a great addition (no more hunting for old micro USB cables), the side scroll is excellent, and the MagSpeed scroll wheel is so smooth and quiet.I just wish that the PC version was offered in more colours, like the Mac version is. Would also be nice to have a removable rechargeable battery like the Performance MX (replacing batteries is how it lasted for a decade), but I guess you can't have everything. Oh well. Not going to dock points for that.If you loved the Performance MX, definitely give the MX 3 a spin (pun intended)!",11-Mar-21
2343,Karthik Verma Jampani,5,this mouse has made me lazy. its probably the best ergonomic mouse i have ever used. it allows for so much customization. and the best part is you can configure what each button does for each individual application. paired with mx keys this mouse  is a beast. so comfortable in the hand to use. scroll wheel is so good you can literally go through thousands of lines in a couple of seconds,10-Mar-21

I'm a desktop user only, so I don't take advantage of its ability to go from one screen to another, I just use the mouse primarily with Excel plus photoshop, as well as internet stuff.Don't get me wrong, I've tried many (MANY!!) much cheaper, supposedly full-sized mice over the years (yeah, I've been online since the early '90s), but it's both the Logitech's size as well as its weight that make it, especially in its current iteration (the MX Master 3) the best they've ever produced.If you haven't tried, and you enjoy the ergonomics of a full-sized mouse, this is definitely the one to get.",7-Mar-21

If I want to switch device I have to lift the mouse, flip it over, and press the tiny button and wait to see the light on to know which device it connects to!!! What the design!

<span> A REVIEW (over about a month of use):It's a really well-made mouse, even if it is all plastic with the exception of the scroll wheel and the thumb wheel. The contours for my thumb and my fingers are nicely well done, but I have medium-large hands, so if you have small hands, this may not be comfortable to use. As for day to day operation, it works incredibly well, and I have yet to experience any connectivity and latency issues, double-clicking, battery issues, etc. Then again, I may have gotten lucky and recieved a unit that didn't have these problems, so I can't speak for everyone who buys this mouse.NITPICKING TIME:I did have to go on Google and download the Logitech Options driver software (pretty much the first result when you Google it) so I can customize the button layout, sensitivity, etc, but that doesn't really count as an issue (just my lazy ass). What may be an issue for some is the fact that the Logitech Options app needs to run first in order to activate your custom settings, which can be a bit annoying if you're someone who frequently shuts down and boots up or restarts their computer. I got used to it, but I am pretty patient, so beware if you're impatient.I have also noticed that the infinite scroll can be a double-edged sword at times. When I have to click to select and option of if I have enter in a special character in Word or Docs and the scroll wheel is still moving, it'll pick up on it and accidentally do something else. For example, when copying and pasting a screen shot of enterting a hyphen shortly after scrolling, the document or page's magnification will change because the scroll wheel was still spinning. I'm pretty sure you fix this in the scrolling section of the Logitech Options application or just not flick the scroll wheel as intensely (still have to get used to that part), but I'll have to see if playing with those options will fix it.VERDICT:Although I have only had this mouse for a couple of weeks to a month, I am very pleased with it. I would definitely NOT use this mouse for gaming because there's no precise DPI adjuster (just a sensitivity slider), but I use this mainly for school and browsing the internet (I have a controller dedicated to gaming). I'll update my review if any issues arise, but everything is pretty much working as promised. Is this mouse pricey? Yes. But I think that you do get what you pay for, and what I got is a pretty damn good mouse, soo...you can come to your own conclusion on that.",23-Feb-21

I'd strongly encourage you to buy from Logitech's website directly (so they realize a higher margin and continue to develop great products), or from a local vendor in your area.I also ended up buying the MX Keys to match and love the pair.  I work from home on a PC setup, but also have an iMac which is still my main personal computer.  The FLOW feature provides an understated benefit in this situation.  The combination of the MX Master 3 and MX Keys streamlined my cluttered desk with multiple keyboards and mouses (mice... I don't know the 'right' plural term in the case of a computer mouse, haha).

Unless you're needing a corded keyboard and you're in a whole different category.. this is the show stopper. For work, school, or just personal computer use.. this tops them all. Connect up to 3 devices via bluetooth SO easily! I have my Windows on 1, my Linux on 2.. and my iPad on 3. Perfect.

So far nothing has worked and I've exhausted my search after spending approx. 20 hours troubleshooting. I'm now sure it is the mouse as it starts working again after tapping the mouse against my desk. Bluetooth won't pick up even when the receiver is 3 inches from the mouse.

I wanted to buy a 2nd one so I didn't have to carry it back and forth from work to home all the time... So I bought the latest and greatest MX Master 3.  They changed the design a bit and improved on what was already a good mouse. It's super comfortable to use all day. The free scroll is awesome and the thumb button mapping I use saves me a ton of time when doing tasks.  The battery life is astounding.  I swear I've charged it less than a handful of times in the entire last year.. and that's with all day use at least 5 times a week!The only downside is that sometimes my custom settings don't seem to work. Things like button mappings and mouse sensitivity.  I usually fix this by turning off the mouse and turning it back on again.  I think it's more of a Logitech software issue and not the mouse itself because it still works when things act up.,31-Jan-21
2370,Windbane,5,Used a MX Master V1 for years till the battery started to die. Got this one for christmas and it feels as good as the original MX Master.,28-Jan-21
2371,K. Ross Johnston,5,"I had used a Logitech Performance MX mouse for the past 10 years, and I liked it.  I might have bought another if it was still available.  But the 10-year-old mouse seemed to be getting glitchy, so I considered options.  I bought my wife a MX Master 2S a couple of years ago, and it was an improvement over the Performance MX.  And now, in the evolution of the product, I have this MX 3, which I think is an improvement over the 2S.  The battery life seems excellent.  The scrolling wheels and the placement of the back and forward buttons are an improvement over previous generations.  I'm very pleased and would I buy another one of these if I needed to.",26-Jan-21

2374,amazonuser,2,If I rest my hand on the mouse it constantly right clicks. The right button is too loose and the ergonomic design of the mouse makes my hand fall on the right button. This is an extremely annoying design flaw that they would have spotted if they used human hands for their testing (assuming if any testing was done).,12-Jan-21
2375,Kendall,2,"Bought this as I was looking for a good reliable cordless mouse.  What I got was a mouse that gets maybe 4 days on a charge (not the 70 in the sales blurb).  It's very jumpy.  Moves on it's own.  ""clicks' on it's own.  I gave it two stars mostly because of the programmable buttons, and the overall feel isn't horrible.  But after only 5 days of use, I couldn't be less thrilled with it.  For the price, I expected so very much more.",9-Jan-21

2377,T-Rawk,5,"I am very pleased with this mouse. Feels comfortable in the hand and the free scrolling feature is quite cool. I love using the thumb buttons to navigate web pages. The thumb scroller and special thumb button at the base are not always easy to find, but this likely depends on the size of your hands. I got this with the Mx Keys keyboard for Mac/Linux workflow, and although I primarily still use my gen 1 Apple trackpad, I am very pleased with the purchase.",4-Jan-21
2378,Buyer,2,"For all the price and features boasted, this device unfortunately don’t seem to work with smaller sized adult hands (effectively, cannot reach the middle scroll wheel without sacrificing comfort, and in my usage experience my hands hurt after several days of normal use compared to a regular USB mouse, which was both surprising and rather disappointing since this mouse had boasted its ergonomics features). The Triathlon, which is similarly shaped to the MX Master works perfectly and I would recommend smaller hands users to try that one instead.",1-Jan-21

Even broken, it still worked, but I decided to get a MX Master 3. By far, this is the most comfortable and precise mouse I have ever used. History: I have been using a mouse since the original Macintosh in 1984, and I have worn through many.Pros: precision, customization, comfortCons: battery life could be better for such a large mouse",31-Dec-20
2381,Ash Golizeh,5,"It is definitely the best mouse I've tried so far. Sleek-looking ergonomic mouse with great battery life, high-quality rubberized coating and metal wheels. It's comfortable and brilliantly precise and the thumb wheel, which was one of my main reasons to get this mouse, is a new way of easing my workload while programming.USB-C, quick charge and above all MagSpeed are the cherries on top.",31-Dec-20

2383,Thomas L,3,"The rubbery/soft-touch plastic that covers the entire palm and thumb area degraded in under 6 months of usage. No sweaty gaming was ever done with this mouse.Once it started degrading, the mouse became sticky to the touch and gets worse/slimy as it gets warm after even just light use. Suspect my grip style that has my entire palm and thumb in contact with the mouse has something to do with it as it gets warmer than I would like a mouse to be.Logitech has replaced it under warranty, but how long the replacement will last is what's keeping me from using it. Would have much preferred this to be all ABS plastic instead of the soft touch rubber material.",30-Dec-20
2384,Anonymous,2,too small for large hands. old model fit better,24-Dec-20
2385,Brett Foy,4,"I bought this mouse because I have two laptops on my desk and I wanted to be able to operate both with one mouse. I did some research and came across this one. It is truly almost perfect with one minor flaw. First of all, ergonomics and battery life are great. It also does do what it says that it will do in terms of switching from screen to screen between laptops. However, it seems that the mouse has a preference, or an easier time going in one direction. This could be due to different processing power in my laptops but when it switches to my left laptop, its almost too fast. If I even nick the edge of the screen it will go left but then going back to the right screen, I need to get the mouse to the edge and drag and drag to the right a couple of times to get the mouse to switch back to the right. Also the software (Logitech Flow) that allows this, won't work with my iPad.",20-Dec-20

2391,Jeremy Tang,3,"I've only been using the mouse for about a couple hours, but the more I use it, the more I dislike it. There is just something off about the movement and the weight.  I've used Logitech mice for many years and this seems like a disappointment.When trying to do fine movements for delicate work, I feel like the mouse takes too much force to start it moving. This is problematic because that force inevitably means you'll likely overshoot your target.  It takes way too much mental concentration to use this mouse, rather than it feeling like an extension of yourself.  I'm returning it.",9-Dec-20

2413,Mike,5,"It's a MX mouse and it's great as usual, so there is not much more to be said. I have been using MX mice since forever because they work on glass and I don't have many other options. That said, I have never used the free-spinning scroll wheel because it was hard to scroll slowly with any precision. The new design is amazing and I can finally have free-spinning and precision at the same time!All the buttons work without special software, so that is useful when using the mouse on a work computer that doesn't allow software installs.I always wear out the button contacts of Logitech mice and they start double clicking after a few months. Hopefully they fixed it in the MX Master 3.",14-Oct-20

Only in ratchet mode it doesn't work. but when you put it in free mode i think its called it works. read online this is a issue for this mouse... the first mouse had the problem so i was thinking it was a defect but when i bought a 2nd mouse same issue.

The metal scroll wheels feel super nice and smooth. The one warning I would have is that connections via Bluetooth can be a bit spotty, so if you can, I would use the wireless receiver. Also, avoid having the wireless receiver behind a monitor or cabinet - ideally, it should be within a couple feet of the mouse and have a clear line-of-sight.

I found many other users complained about this problem too on google.

2441,KM,5,"It does require getting used to using this mouse.  It is heavy but grounded and firm.  The right way is to rest your hand right over it and move around by letting the mouse carry your hand weight.With my simple  (cheap)  Logitech mouse, I had to skip up and down often to get the cursor to the right point.  With this mouse, I have to change my habit of just keeping it grounded and sliding. It slides on any surface.The roll was initially tighter and one day it suddenly started just rolling loose, I had not realized that the button, just above is to switch between the controlled moving the cursor vs. the crazy spinning wheel that scrolls in a web page super fast up and down.  This is one of my favourite features about this Logitech.  The sideways spin is great too.Today, this mouse suddenly stopped working.  It turns out that my USB extension bar, where the mouse USB was attached, was faulty.  As soon as I attached it to the USB port on the computer, the mouse started working again.I purchased this about a month ago.  I use a mouse, on average, about 15 hours per day.  I work in design and web development.  This mouse is expensive, but you feel the quality right away.  As long as it keeps going, I will replace my other mice with same or a little cheaper variety.  I have difficulty using my previous mouse now, they rather feel flimsy and less controllable.  Once you use this mouse, you will not want to go back to a lesser quality mouse.",25-Aug-20

2470,Cameron Dyck,4,"the reason for buying this mouse was to replace my Magic Mouse. the gestures with this mouse are ok but not great, im still finding myself needing to use the trackpad to do certain gestures. the buttons are kind of limited as to what you can do. but the comfort and performance lives up to the name. would not recommend for small hands",18-May-20

2475,Bennet,5,"The Logitech MX Master 3 is one of the most comfortable mice I've ever used. I wear medium-sized gloves and my hands rest perfectly on the shape of the mouse. I was also impressed with its battery life. I use the mouse about 8 hours a day on average and I only need to charge once every 30 days or so. As someone who uses multiple computers (PC desktop and a Macbook Pro), this mouse allows me to connect both my computers and seamlessly move between them as if they were a single computer. It even lets you copy and paste from one machine to another, which is highly useful for me. The build quality is also top-notch. The metal scroll wheels make the product feel premium, and they're super smooth as well.There are 2 side buttons that you can configure and I initially found them to be too thin/small. I did get used to them after a while so it wasn't a big deal. As for the gesture button, I have personally never used it as a gesture. I personally found it kind of slow to press down and move the mouse a certain direction to do something and I just assigned the key as a shortcut when I press it instead of using gestures.Overall, this is a fantastic mouse; the best you can get if you want a productivity mouse. However, if you're someone who plays games a lot, there are better options out there. This is a big and heavy mouse and is a very poor choice for FPS games.",3-May-20

2480,Chris Knudson,3,"I bought this mouse to replace my aging Performance MX.  This new one has some really nice features, and some real disappointments.<br>Pros:-I really like the shape, weight, and how this mouse fits in my hand (for the most part - see Cons section re thumbweel).-Love the new ""MagShift"" scroll wheel.  Scrolling fills me with joy again.-New Logitech Flow feature, allowing me to use one mouse and keyboard with multiple computers absolutely seamlessly.  Where has this feature been all my life?  Absolutely wonderful.Cons:-Thumbwheel is a bit of a reach and has limited applicability, except in specific applications.-Gesture button (below the thumb) is difficult to reach, and impossible to press without accidentally moving the mouse as well.-New ""Options"" software lacks the ability to set pointer acceleration.-Application specific button setup doesn't seem to work in every application.-It took many attempts to get the mouse paired with receivers on multiple computers.Overall, if it weren't for the ""Flow"" functionality, I probably would have returned this mouse.  But now that I've had a taste of that feature, I don't think I can live without it, and this is probably the best mouse I am going to find with that feature for now.</br>",24-Apr-20

2485,Simon Coutellier-Savard,1,"The mouse is GREAT. I love the ergonomics way better than the 2s, which I already loved. The buttons are even better than before, and the mouse is overall a great piece of technology.Except for one MAJOR flaw. Whenever you lift off the mouse from the mousepad, however how slightly, then it stops sending scrolling information to the computer, for some reason. That means that for people like me who are used to having fast workflows see CONSTANT issues in the way we browse application or the net, because scrolling stops regularly and seems to lag.People have reported it all over the net. It is an issue with the mouse itself, not a quality control issue. We know this because people have exchanged their mice for other ones and they demonstrated the same exact issue. It probably doesn't bother every user because not every user use their mouse in this way, but this is absolutely not a normal behavior for a mouse and the 2s didn't have that issue.What is really frustrating is that Logitech is once again simply ignoring the issue, just like they do with other design flaws plaguing some of their products. It's a shame because I love their products, when they work, but this kind of behavior demonstrates a huge lack of respect for their customers, and I'm beginning to think I should switch to another company for my mice...",13-Mar-20
2486,Mikael,2,"Cons in comparison to the original Performance MX-Only 1 year warranty instead of 3.-SHORTER : if placed comfortably in the hand my 3 fingers are too far away to click... A huge issue.-Narrower I now have my fourth finger rubbing the mouse pad instead of resting on the side of the mouse.-Lighter, no so important but feel cheaper.-Even if you put the center scroll wheel to stepped mode it switch to free roll if you turn it to fast or long enough so this button is partially useless, at least it can be mapped to something else. (like switching mouse resolution)Pro-I love the horizontal scroll wheel-Button/wheels can be configured for each program which is greatSadly as I use my mouse sometime more then 12 hours per day if the comfort is not perfect I will injure myself. I already feel a slight pain and stiffness after only one short day !I will have to return this mouse and buy parts to repair my old Performance MX v1. An Omron mini switch cost a couple dollars!This is a shame since I found the horizontal scroll wheel very useful.",12-Mar-20
2487,Uko,5,"I've been using this mouse for about a month now and it's absolutely fine. The smooth scrolling is a lot nicer and quieter than the 2S. Not a major difference but it is noticeable.The build quality doesn't feel as nice as the 2S but it's not huge.For some reason my hand heated up more with the mouse and would sweat but after a while I didn't notice it. It's probably due to the finish material being somewhat grippy.This is a good mouse and would not go back to the 2S however, I do wish they would up the build quality when they roll out the MX4",7-Mar-20

2490,Cyclocommuter,5,"This mouse is replacing a Logitech MX Revolution which I have been using for the last 5 or so years. It has both a wireless mode (when used with the supplied USB dongle) and a Bluetooth mode.ConnectivitySince my motherboard has built-in Bluetooth, I am using this mode/option. Battery life when in Bluetooth mode is excellent. After two months of daily use the battery level dropped to 50% from fully charged.  This is definitely much better than the battery life of my MX Revolution which I typically had to recharge every 2 weeks.SoftwareThe supplied software is ok. It seems lighter in footprint than the old software that I was using with the MX Revolution. It basically allows you to configure the mouse the way you want it to work. There are default settings for various Apps like Chrome, MS Office, etc. The mouse is fully configurable if the software you are using is not in the default list. For example, I was able to configure the thumb scroll to switch between tabs when using the Firefox browser.FeaturesThe main reason I got this mouse is because of the notch-less scroll wheel which has become my favorite feature ever since I tried it on my older Logitech mice. This feature can still be switched on and off (I prefer it at notch-less most of the time) and I love how I can scroll through pages with just the flick. The wheel appear to be both heavier and smoother than ever. It does have a new mag-wheel mechanism whereby when in notch mode, it automatically switches to free-wheel or notch-less mode whenever the wheel is flicked hard enough... Going back to notch mode as the wheel slows down. I still prefer notch-less all the time but this is a nice feature for those who might want it.ErgonomicsThis is where I think my older MX Revolution beats the new MX Master 3. The MX Master 3 borders on becoming a little too big whereas the MX Revolution in my opinion is sized just right. It also takes getting used to when reaching for the back and forward buttons with your thumb. Those buttons were more readily accessible on the MX Revolution. However, the thumb scroller on the MX Master 3 is much better and more accessible than the thumb wheel on the MX Revolution. Overall I have a slight preference to the MX Master 3 over the MX Revolution mainly because of the smoother scroll wheel and also the more usable thumb scroller.Final wordsThis mouse would have been perfect if it were sized the same as my MX Revolution. However it is still an excellent mouse and I have no hesitation recommending it.",29-Feb-20

For a mouse that performs this well we expected to have to change the batteries far more frequently than we have had to.

2500,Hart,3,"I was looking forward to a more ergonomic mouse and was hoping this would do the trick. So far after weeks of use I still can't get used to the way it handles and the mushy buttons. There are some good points but overall I don't like it.► I like the looks and appreciate the rubberized exterior which makes it easy to hang on to, I wish all mice were set up like this. I also like the weight, I prefer a mouse that feels like I'm actually holding onto something.► This is the first mouse I've got my hands on that uses a type C USB cable for charging (included) and I've not had any problems using it while connected to a USB cable for charging.► Forward/backward buttons are placed nicely and have decent action on them. They are also small enough to not get in the way or be activated when not desired but big enough to easily feel when running a thumb across them.For me, there was one thing that really stood out, the idea that this mouse could be used across different systems seamlessly. Yes software would need to be installed and connection would require both the dongle and Bluetooth but if it worked it could save me time and desk space as I could eliminate two other mice.The concept here is great, this could be a real bonus for those of us who do a lot of work between computers but while the concept is great the execution is not. I found that the software wasn't always working seamlessly. The idea is that you have one mouse that can be used across different systems. We would be able to copy files between different computers as well as use the mouse seamlessly between them. While this works it has it's flawed, primarily the problem is that it sometimes stops functioning without any apparent reason. I've also had issues where a file I was transferring didn't get copied over. Nothing out of the ordinary, things like 200kb PDF's.I was also intrigued to see how well the scroll wheel would work. It's touted as ""Ultrafast Magspeed Electromagnetic Scrolling"" but it results in sloppy performance. What's that supposed to mean anyway? Yes, there is the ability to scroll super fast through a long document or web page but when control is needed to stop, go backward, or back to a specific point that I just flew past the control isn't there. I don't immediately get the same speed backward and this then results in a lot of scrolling back up again.► The scroll wheel itself is decent, the metal has decent knurling which keeps it from being slippery and there are mild indents that you can feel when scrolling.► Left and right mouse buttons are too soft and give almost no tactile feedback that the button has been pressed.► The left/right scroll wheel located above the back/forward buttons is difficult to use, it sits recessed too far and offers a lot of resistanceUsing the software allows for some customization such as button actions and DPI settings but there is nothing spectacular.► On the upside like the other Logitech products, I own the battery life is great. This is one aspect of wireless products that the company is excellent at.► Pad's on the bottom are also good, the whole thing slides nicely over both metallic and neoprene based mousepads and the sensor tracks on any surface I've tried it on.If the tech inside worked as designed it would be worth the money but as it is I couldn't recommend spending this much for poor to wonky performance not to mention the poor action on the two main buttons.",7-Feb-20

2505,Serge Preville,2,I have used many top of the line Logitech gear over the years and have been satisfied with all of them but unfortunately the MX Master 3 that I have just received and put to work immediately looks like a very huge disappointment.

I loose the arrow 70% of the time and it is very difficult to bring it at a specific target as the arrow does not respond at all.

2512,Nat,5,"WHAT I LIKE:- The battery lasts forever. It came partially charged, and I still have not recharged it after about 2 weeks of use. Although that could be because I only use this for about an hour each day. So, I am very happy with the battery life so far.- Very comfortable to hold and use. There are several buttons and controls if you are a techie or high volume user. I don't use those buttons much. But, they are there to make the use more comfortable.- Very accurate and fast response. There is almost no lag between the mouse and the computer. The connection is instant and I have not observed any lags yet. The mouse also has different dpi settings that you can change manually. So, the higher dpi setting will give you more accurate and minute level performance.- I absolutely love the fact that this mouse does not come with a dongle and is truly wireless. It has built-in bluetooth connection and simply connects to the computer through bluetooth. One reason why I love the dongle-free design is because I have lost at least 2-3 dongles of my wirelss mouse before, which makes the mouse useless. So, the dongle-free design is great for people like me who keep losing the dongles.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:- While the mouse is very easy to use, very comfortable and just glides through the screen, it is a little too large. It looks like it is built for people with very large hands. So, people with small hands may find this a little too big to use. Otherwise, this is an excellent wireless mouse.",20-Dec-19

2514,Canadian Car Guy,4,"I was really looking forward to trying this mouse out! I always buy Logitech mice anyway (my last two have been M510s, best standard 5 button wireless mouse on the market in my opinion), but this MX Master 3 is not ideal for my usage. I will explain.My main issues are:#1 - One of the major functions touted for this mouse is the electromagnetic scroll wheel, which is supposed to go between standard scrolling and high speed ""free-scrolling"" by scrolling further and faster automatically. I find that is varies wildly whether this happens or not depending on what program you're using, and even in the same programs sometimes. I will intentionally try to make it high speed scroll, and sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. To be clear, it DOES work in every program I've tried it in, just the criteria and detection of these criteria seems to vary from moment to moment. Maybe this will ""work in"" as it loosens up with time.NOTE: This can be ameliorated by using the manual ""mode switch"" button behind the main scroll wheel, but it takes long to do that than to just keep scrolling until it works.#2 - My hands are on the small side for a man. Not ridiculously so, I wear medium-large gloves for example, but this mouse feels ""too big"" to be comfortable, or to reach all the buttons without changing hand position. The thumb buttons in particular suffer from this. Again, to clarify, I normally use a full sized mouse, not a laptop ""portable"" mouse, so this is not from being used to an unreasonably tiny mouse.OK, those are my only criticisms, and they are subjective, especially #2 which is completely negated if your hands are bigger than mine. :)Everything else is great! The build quality and materials are excellent. There are no rattles when you shake it, everything is put together tightly and solidly. The plastic of the body is a nice lightly textured plastic, with a soft, almost rubberized feel (though I believe it is not). The buttons are clicky in a positive engagement type of way without being obnoxious, the 4000 DPI sensor provides smooth and accurate tracking on any surface, the thumb wheel allows scrolling through tabs in your browser very easily (and any number of other functions in apps like Photoshop, Premiere, etc), and the battery life is excellent. I've been using it for 12+ hours a day every day for almost two weeks with no need for a charge yet.Overall, I am a fan, I just wish it were a tiny bit shorter in profile, because then it would fit my hand perfectly. In most ways, this is a top tier mouse, and someone who works in CAD or Photoshop or coding would get better functionality from it than I do. But if you have small hands, maybe try something else to prevent giving yourself hand cramps.",13-Dec-19

2518,Luke,4,"The Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless is a big, comfortable mouse that's intended for premium ergonomics and productivity. The first thing you will notice is that the mouse is pretty big. It covers my entire palm. My palm sits comfortably on it. My hands are on the smaller side so sometimes it does feel a little big and clunky. The scroll wheel is massive and feels very heavy duty and premium. It provides smooth and fast scrolling with an amazing feel. Having said that, some websites like Twitter don't play nicely when scrolling up because it's much slower than scrolling down. I would prefer scrolling up was just as smooth as scrolling down, but I do feel that this is the websites' fault since in programs like Word and Adobe scrolling up is just as fast. I love the side scroll wheel. On Chrome it switches fast from window to window, making productivity and multi-tasking much faster.  The forward and backward buttons are also very useful.Overall, the mouse feels very precise with the 4000DPI sensor. I do not need any special surface as my desk is sufficient. Using it for a month, I've had to recharge it just once using the micro USB. I think I would prefer batteries instead because they last a lot longer and are not expensive to swap out. However, they would make this mouse heavier. One of the best features of this mouse is the Flow technology that allows the cursor to move seamlessly across three computer screens and copy and paste files from one to the other. I use this almost every day as its simple to use and saves lots of time. No more USB sticks or clunky Windows One Drive that doesn't work half the time.  Overall, I think this mouse is amazing if you're looking for a heavy-duty, comfortable mouse with increased functionality and premium features.",9-Dec-19

2523,Willy Speeckaert,5,This mouse works exactly as described.,5-Dec-19
2524,Ryan,5,"It is expensive for a mouse, but since I was able to have it covered by work, it is totally worth it.If you work an office job and are holding a mouse for hours every day, this is the mouse to get.",5-Dec-19
2525,Vladimir,5,"I have been an exclusive MX Master mouse user since the first version came out and I tend to wear out my mouse and keyboard every 2 years.Deciding whether to upgrade to version 3 or just get another 2S for half the price was a toss up this year.The deciding factor for me was the claim that it is silent when scrolling with scroll wheel click enabled.I have been using it for two days and must say that the upgrade was well worth the price. Not only is it silent when scrolling with clicks, it has a much smoother vertical and horizontal wheel scrolling. It is noticeably lighter than Master 2S.Overall I am extremely satisfied with its performance and ergonomics. Battery life will take a while to confirm but if it is anything like Master 2S, I will forget when I charged it last.",2-Dec-19
2526,Adam,5,"This is simply one of the best mice you can buy. Full stop.From a build quality standpoint, this is as close to tank-like as you can get. It feels incredibly solid and well made. The two scroll wheels are both made of metal which gives this mouse an especially premium feel. The main body is made with soft-touch plastic. The buttons are very clicky and give great tactile feedback. There are exceptionally large low friction pads on the bottom resulting in very smooth and effortless movement over your desk surface. The only thing with the physical design some people might not like is the positioning of your hand. Yes, it is ergonomic. However, if you like to have your hand positioned horizontally instead of at about a 35-degree angle, this might take a bit to get used to. Another positive is USB-C charging. It's 2019, EVERYTHING should have USB-C at this time.The setup is easy. You have a choice to use either Bluetooth or the USB receiver to connect it to your computer. I tried both and there were no issues with the setup or use of either. With most mice, I don't recommend installing any special software. It just creates bloat on your PC and they typically add very little to the functionality of the mouse. That is not the case for this mouse. By installing the software you unlock two incredibly powerful features: contextual actions and the ability to use one mouse across several computers.The contextual actions are something that makes so much sense, you wonder why it hasn't been done for decades. Depending on what program you are doing, you can have buttons perform different actions. Different buttons can even perform actions depending on what you have your mouse hovering over.The less useful (for most people) feature the software has is the ability to use the mouse across different computers. If you have a laptop and a desktop beside each other, you can use the same mouse to control both, moving the cursor from one to another seamlessly as if they were two screens attached to the same computer. You can also cut, copy, and paste between the two as well. Although this is more of a niche use, it is incredibly powerful.Overall, if you are looking for a new mouse, don't hesitate to get this one.",1-Dec-19
2527,"The Westleys<span class=""a-icon a-profile-verified-badge""><span class=""a-profile-verified-text""></span></span>",5,"This is probably the best wireless mouse I’ve ever used. It has a ton of additional features, and on top of that it handles the basic stuff better than any mouse I’ve ever owned. It looks great, it’s extremely intuitive, and it works flawlessly on just about any surface. Once you get used to it, you’ll also find that it has a wealth of features and additional functions that you can put to great use.The overall shape and feel of the mouse is extremely comfortable. The curved design is easy on the wrist and there’s a groove where your thumb naturally rests. On top of being comfortable, there are also several additional buttons and controls that are placed in just the right way to make them easy to reach if you know how to use them. For example the horizontal scroll wheel is located on the side of the mouse, right above the thumb, making it extremely simple to use. Right below that are two more buttons which can be used for many things, but by default they can be used (for example) with your web browser to go forward or backwards. The scroll wheel is probably the best I’ve ever seen, with two different modes you can choose from: either a totally smooth scroll, or a “Ratchet” mode where you can feel slight bumps to help you scroll line-by-line. If you want to switch modes, just press the button below the scroll wheel to flip back and forth between the two.Speaking of those extra buttons, you can get a lot more out of them if you choose to download the Logitech program that is partnered with this device. It’s called Logitech Options, and it’s free and simple to install. Once you have it set up, it allows you to adjust lots of little things on your mouse, including choosing what all the extra buttons do. For example, if you don’t need to change your scroll wheel mode, you can instead program that button to change your mouse speed, which is what I did. There’s many ways you can customize all the buttons on your mouse using this program, and on top of that certain programs can be set up to use certain buttons in certain ways, such as Microsoft Word or your web browser using the buttons to do things like “Undo” or zoom in or out.One feature that this mouse boasts, and which it absolutely lives up to, is the claim that it works accurately on virtually any surface. Anyone who has used a wireless mouse knows that sometimes these kinds of devices don’t work well on some surfaces, such as glass tables. This mouse works absolutely perfectly on any surface I tried, no matter what it was made of or how reflective it was. It was always smooth and accurate no matter what, which is a huge relief if you find yourself working on your computer in different places as I do.The battery life on this mouse is also really impressive. It boasts 70 days of use on a single charge, and based on my use of it the past few weeks, I believe it. I’m careful to turn off my mouse when I’m not using it, and as a result I’ve barely used 15% of the battery and have yet to recharge it despite weeks of frequent use. It also charges via a USB-C cable, which is much faster than the usual micro-USB cables, though they are still a lot less common.One final feature I want to mention, which most users probably won’t need, is the ability to connect to multiple devices by bluetooth and USB, and switch between three devices with the press of a button on the bottom of the mouse. If you happen to be working on two different computers and switching back and forth between them, just connect both via bluetooth and you can easily switch from one to the other while still using the same mouse. It’s a feature only a few people would use regularly, but if you are one of those people it’s extremely useful!Overall this is a fantastic mouse. It’s comfortable, it lasts a very long time, and it has a ton of features that are helpful and easy to learn. It works on any surface and can be tweaked to your liking for work, for video games, and for multimedia work like video and photo editing. It’s extremely versatile, but still simple enough for anyone to use it. Though this mouse is designed for a certain type of career, regular people will also love it, the long battery and ergonomic design simply can’t be beat!",29-Nov-19
2528,Sara ,4,"Much improved compared to the MX Master 2 in regards to scroll wheel/thumb button. Easier to spin.  Nativation buttons are better positioned.Pretty good battery life if their claims are true.  Haven't used it long enough to say yet.Bluetooth, USB Dongle",28-Nov-19
2529,Kokopelli,5,This Logitech mouse works very well! It’s been used for routine computer work &amp; games. It’s worked perfectly on every surface it’s been used on. Very responsive. A great change from using a laptop touch pad.,26-Nov-19
2530,ChrisN,5,"I gave this mouse a solid 3 weeks of testing and I'm not switching to anything else.I love it. The MX master 3 seems to be made for my large hands (6'3"" dude).It's superbly smooth, I work across 3 monitors all day and draw for most of it. The mouse is my bread and butter tool.The software is an executable that I was able to install at work - even with our super-tight security settings- so that's a HUGE plus. You can configure the buttons and scroll wheels to what you like. For me that means complex bind-keys on my keyboard for my cad software can now be one click...I haven't figured out what to configure the thumb wheel yet, I tried volume, but it can go up when you least expect it if you brush the wheel by mistake with your thumb.The main scroll wheel is divine. If you give it a rapid spin, the magnetic mechanism releases it and it free spins, so you want to scroll down to page a million in some code, no problem.It's great that it's wireless, and I use the dongle it comes with since my pc has no bluetooth (yea, I design parts of phones for next year with old computers, go figure).Did I mention the mouse accuracy is amazing?Give this mouse a go if you work with the mouse ALL day and want extra comfort with amazing precision and customizable buttons.I have nothing bad to say and only excellent experience with it so far.",25-Nov-19
2531,Void,5,"I like this mouse, it works perfectly with mac.Unfortunately you can't customize the mouse on Linux :(",23-Nov-19
2532,Eric,5,"I have two of the previous generation and this is an improvement in every way.- Wheel moves easier, and the magnetic lock on this one seems to actually work, as opposed the previous gen that would release the lock after some period of time- Slightly smaller than the previous one, no real opinion on that for me, but those with smaller hands will like it better- Side-scrolling wheel actually useful now. Previous one was too hard to use, and I just ignored it.- Somehow the clicks feel better too. Can't articulate how, but they feel nicer.",22-Nov-19
2533,Gage,4,"Review update: Every now and again the mouse will decide to start lagging and jumping across the screen. This is very annoying and I do not know why it does this since it is random. Other than this, it functions great!So I've never used a mouse beyond the basic design and I must say I love the feel of this mouse. I find most mice are too small and don't feel well designed, but this one is almost perfect for me. I say almost because my ring finger and pinky kind of hang off the side of the mouse, I feel like it could have been extended slightly to accommodate for this. The application that it asks you to download (not required) is very user friendly as it let's you reprogram every button and wheel on the mouse to whatever you want! The downside is that I noticed the app runs in the background and uses some RAM. The wheels are very smooth and noiseless while the buttons don't have a cheap press to them. I would for sure consider this mouse if you're looking for something more ergonomic.",22-Nov-19
2534,Bob,1,"The scroll wheel has a manufacturing defect that Logitech refuses to acknowledge, the scrolling is inconsistent and does not work half the time when you use it. For such a high priced mouse this is not acceptable. I upgraded from a Master Mouse 2S and the same mouse works fine in my computer. I have replaced the Master Mouse 3, three times now and they all exhibit the same problem.Stay away from this product until Logitech figures out QA. The Master Mouse 2S is still a great mouse and has no issues.",21-Nov-19
2535,FAST EDDY,5,"This mouse has to be close to the perfect shape that a mouse could ever be. If you reach out with your hand like you are reaching for a mouse, that's the shape it is.  It feels perfectly natural in your hand. It also feels sturdy and very well made. The mouse wheel has just the right amount of resistance when scrolling (line by line precise clicks) but give it a flick and it automatically goes into freewheeling mode (very cool feature). The left and right mouse buttons are long so they can accommodate a wide variety of finder lengths. The thumb rest is great and keep you from dragging your thumb all over the pad. The thumb wheel on the side scrolls left and right (test it out in a spread sheet). Under the thumb wheel is the back and forward buttons and below that under your thumb on the thumb rest there is another button (changes desktops etc). on the under side the 123 switch changes the monitor.It has very long battery life between charges (maybe three to four weeks).On the down side the only thing I could think of to complain about is the size of the power button. It is smaller than I like. I hate messing with a mini buttons although it's not as small as most. Put a power button on top or a larger slider on the bottom.The price is slightly excessive but you get what you pay for.",21-Nov-19
2536,Suxiaoma,5,"By just looking at the price, it is such an expensive computer mouse. However, it does have a lot of nice features. The ergonomic design makes it very comfortable to hold and use. The thumb wheel and controls are placed strategically. The scrolling is super fast and precise. Another important feature is the fast charging and long battery life. This is an impressive computer mouse. If you do a lot of gaming and extensive work on a computer, it is for you.",20-Nov-19
2537,Randomroyalty,1,Nice mouse but useless software. Stay away.Last 2 versions of the Logitech Options (v7.x and v8.x) can pair the mouse but then can’t detect it. There is no way to configure or activate the advanced features of the mouse.A real pain as I’m on a managed computer and have to deal with IT to try different versions of the software in order to troubleshoot.,19-Nov-19
2538,Travis W.,5,"Very comfortable, intuitive interface and high quality components here!  Very pleased to see the USB C charge port.  Surfing and word processing right out of the box, I look forward to using this mouse for some video editing.",19-Nov-19
2539,IamMe,4,"This mouse is super comfortable - the ergonomic features are awesome! I do a lot of scrolling and it's so easy with this mouse, it's really responsive.",19-Nov-19
2540,William Chow,2,"I like the comfort of this mouse, button placement and overall usability. However, it has a terrible tracking. It skips all over the screen. Not smooth at all.",18-Nov-19
2541,fox,5,Fantastic. Overall easy to setup once you download the logitech software. I love how well it tracks on all surfaces verse my older logitech mx1100 (RCR147) mouse that now freezes and skips like crazy.,18-Nov-19
2542,Fred G,5,"I love the way the Logitech MX Master 3 Advanced Wireless Mouse - Graphite looks and works. The mouse is smooth and the keys are thoughtfully placed. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is a bit too tall for my hand (I have relatively smallish hands). It think it is a great product, but not necessarily for small hands.",16-Nov-19
2543,Mr. D,5,This mouse is SUPER comfortable to use; it's very ergonomic. It's simple plug &amp; play and the software is pretty straightforward to use. I really enjoy the magnetic scroll wheel. That wheel should be a standard. It tracks smooth and does its job perfectly. So far so good.,15-Nov-19
2544,LJ,5,"Excellent ergonomics, improved thumb button layout and wheel, suitable for medium to large hands, USB-c, tracks on glass, 4000 dpi, 1 minute fast charge will provide three hours of use, and thumb button activates a nice window tiling feature.  Nothing not to like about this mouse, and a defiantly improvements over the original MX in terms of thumb button layout with now has no obvious criticisms imo.  However, people with small hands might feel more comfortable with a slightly smaller mouse.Longer review: Big fan of Logitech's MX series mice.  I’ve had several and the original MX Master was my current daily driver at work, so I jumped at the chance to review the MX Master 3.  My initial observation suggested I wouldn't find much of a differences, however, after spending a couple days with it, I’m pleasantly surprised, and can say that it’s worthy upgrade over the original MX master, and an excellent mouse overall. It really is a big improvement over the original.  First, the sensor has been upgraded.  You can physical tell that it’s different, and it had no issues tracking over glass and shiny surfaces, which is super handy (The manual says the glass must be at least 4mm thick)The layout of the thumb buttons has also been improved. Now the back and forward buttons are nicely raised and spaced out better allowing for easy access.  The horizontal thumb wheel is also bigger and more comfortable to uses.  The main right and left mouse buttons feel the same, and have a nice tactile click.  The fit and finish is excellent as is to be expected from Logitech.  As for fit, the mouse has a slightly smaller palm rest then the original MX, and has a little less pronation caused by a slight increased angle of the palm rest.  I also noticed that the thumb rest button activates a different windows tile feature then the original, which is actually very useful if you often have varies apps and windows open, particularly when dealing with multiple windows, without the need to install any additional software – really handy when you using it on a work computer that doesn’t allow additional software to be installed.  The electromagnetic scroll wheel is very nice and feels  similar to the original MX master which I’ve been using for years without issue.  You can also connect up to three devices, and select them via the hardware switch on the button of the mouse, similar as the previous master. Works really well if you have to switch between computers, or devices.  It also has USB-C charging, which will give you three hours of uses for 1 minute of charging – that’s pretty amazing.  A full charge will power the mouse for up to 70 days, though your millage may vary.  Really happy to see usb-c over the older micro usb connection.  All in all, this is a worthy successor.  Only quibble I have, is that the original had a three LED status light re battery power, and this one only has one.",14-Nov-19
2545,McGadget,5,"The MX Master 3 Mouse is truly a beautiful ergonomic mouse.  It has all the functions of a regular mouse and  much more.The scroll wheel has two modes.  A precise mode for slow accurate line by line scrolling and a fast mode to scroll through lines in record speed.  The mouse has a side scroll wheel which is great to use for spreadsheets that go off screen as well as back and forward buttons just below it.  On the right side where your thumb will rest if you press down once it will show everything that is open on your desktop.  Keep it pressed and you can open a second or third desktop on you laptop or PC (I am using Windows 10).Underneath the mouse you have the on/off switch and a another switch to switch between paired devices.  I was able to switch between my Android Tablet to my laptop with ease.  What surprised me most is that it actually even worked on the Tablet since there was no indication that it would other than it works with Linux so I gave it a try.The battery charge is amazing.  Three minutes will give you a day's worth of charge and on a full charge it can last up to 70 days.To pair, turn it on, press the 1,2,3 button to the number of your choice, from your device's BT find the MX Master and pair it.  It is that easy.  To add more do the same thing but choose a different number.  It also comes with a dongle.  Unfortunately, the mouse does not appear to have onboard storage for the dongle.  The only minor con I could find.This is the most ergonomic and  comfortable mouse I have ever used.  Movements are precise.  There are good tutorial videos on how to get the most of this mouse.  I am torn between using it at work for for home use, so I will likely have to purchase another one as I like it that much.",14-Nov-19
2546,Prithvi Shams,5,Works just as well as advertised. I wish it had a dedicated battery indicator so that I would not have to open the desktop app every time I wanted to check remaining battery life!,13-Nov-19
